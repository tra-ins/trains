    <h4>12/9/24 &#45; 5:15 PM CST &#45; Math EOCs</h4>
    <h1>Did Math EOC part 1 today. Today was meh.</h1>
    <p>35 minutes to do 15 questions, and I did terrible. I really should have practiced. Anyway, in Criminal Justice my teacher went over the exact same notes as last time so I just read MtD and he put on a documentary about OJ Simpson. In Geometry we did the test. In English we read an excerpt from a Machiavelli book or something and did the Macbeth anticipation guide. In Spanish we learned more Spanish.</p>
