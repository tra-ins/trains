    <h4>3/28/23 &#45; 7:30 PM CDT &#45; The 2nd Beta Meeting</h4>
    <h1>Today was mid.</h1>
    <p>Green patterned collared shirt time!!!! Science was...something. So, the teacher kept saying how controversial evolution is and that "it's just a theory not proven"; he was saying how some of us might not believe in it and how he doesn't, and he kept making fun of Charles Darwin. He wasn't too stupid to be a doctor, he just didn't want to be a doctor and instead a naturalist. I've always wonder if he's qualified to be a teacher.</p>
    <p>On the announcements, ykw girl's birthday was announced. Before ELA, I said happy birthday to them, to be nice, and I can't remember what they said, I think it was 'thanks' or something. But every time someone mentioned their birthday, they sounded mad or embarrassed, and when the math teacher asked, they said their birthday was tomorrow. HELP???? I FEEL MIXED FEELINGS??? DO I FEEL BAD OR EMBARRASSED OR?? Anyway ELA was fine.</p>
    <p>At lunch, this table of popular kids kept talking about me behind my back very loudly, so I stared at them. They were like "omg omg she looked!!" and then I waved to them, and they were like "SHE WAVED!!!" and I kept staring at them.</p>
    <p>Math, umm rotations whatever I don't care.</p>
    <p>Theater, I missed it yesterday so I didn't have a partner, YESSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!! Supposed to be interviewing someone, whatever, wrote some of my 1 minute speech.</p>
    <p>Extra PE boring whatever.</p>
    <p>Beta meeting!! I slept through the game, woke up by an officer for attendance. I was forced to sit with some random table and we had to decorate bags that we put eggs with candy inside in. I put propaganda for my school (not stinky not even magnet) on the bag and silly OMORI reference. Ate McDonald's and went to Walmart after, I guess.</p>
    <p>JTA Day 22; god only knows if it can continue due to the acceptance letter</p>
    <p>bye</p>
