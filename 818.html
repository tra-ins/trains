    <h4>1/9/25 &#45; 5:00 PM CST &#45; Jenga</h4>
    <h1>Today was okay.</h1>
    <p>In JROTC we talked about space (like last year). In Criminal Justice, we just did some notes, and I started reading The Vampire Armand during OT. In Spanish, we did that Jenga game again but with review of vocabulary terms, I said a few, and it was quite fun. Honestly, I kind of like my teacher. And in Biology, I messaged a friend a bit, then we did some quick notes, and I read the rest of the time.</p>
    <p>yeah bye; no school tomorrow!!!!!</p>
