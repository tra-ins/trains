    <h4>5/8/25 &#45; 4:56 PM CDT &#45; Yeah</h4>
    <h1>Today was eh.</h1> 
    <p>JROTC did my drill test. CJ did notes. Spanish did work. In Spanish class, these girls who were recording their project (the day before the deadline) got interrupted by someone who just walked in the classroom and in front of the camera, so they had to rerecord it with 5-10 minutes left in class. I thought that was funny. In Biology, I just read.</p>
