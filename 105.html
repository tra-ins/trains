    <h4>1/27/23 &#45; 4:51 PM CST &#45; Friar Laurence</h4>
    <h1>Today was ok.</h1>
    <p>Science test: 19/20. Kill me.</p>
    <p>ELA: Played Friar Laurence, SLAYED. I WAS SO GOOD. HAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAA, NATURAL BORN ACTOR...</p>
    <p>Also recited The Prologue perfectly and got a 100 and got to skip the writing prompt on the Unit Test Monday. Finally done with the R&J Prologue, and with all of the actual play except the test.</p>
    <p>Also during lunch, I made a joke about what happened on Picture Day (traumatic), and my friend said that I saw it coming. I did. Lol.</p>
    <p>Uhh math was easy as always.</p>
    <p>Art we continued the thing we started a few days ago, and the guys at my table started yelling "FREE TATE!" so...yikes...</p>
    <p>RTI was RTI.</p>
    <p>bye...</p>
