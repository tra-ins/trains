    <h4>12/17/22 &#45; 6:38 PM CST &#45; Mall</h4>
    <h1>Today was good, a nice Saturday.</h1>
    <p>I woke up at 11 in the morning and headed straight to a mall like an hour away across state lines. The mall was mid, got a few clothes at the Old Navy there, and ate at a pretty decent restaurant.</p>
    <p>Honestly not much to say.</p>
    <p>bye.</p>
