    <h4>10/8/24 &#45; 0:00 AM AST &#45; Ooh Boats! + Lesbian Day!!!!</h4>
    <h1>This day was Lesbian Day and Lucy Dacus performed her love song about Julien at Brooklyn Steel! So wow, I missed out. I think I was super tired and nearly collapsed, very sunburnt, but the boat ride was super cool aside from me struggling to stay awake at the beginning.</h1>
    <p>Bye</p>
