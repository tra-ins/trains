    <h4>11/10/23 &#45; 4:35 PM CST &#45; Pancakes</h4>
    <h1>today was ok</h1>
    <p>In JROTC, we played kickball and I kicked the ball twice, and both times I got an out. Wow. I kept trying to get near the front to kick, and hopefully run near my crush (she has a crush on me ong) (she doesn't). In Algebra, we did an EOC packet. In Culinary, we made pancakes (they were so good!!!). And in theater, I did a unit reflection.</p>
    <p>tis all</p>
