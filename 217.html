    <h4>5/19/23 &#45; 5:09 PM CDT &#45; Awards</h4>
    <h1>Today was decent.</h1>
    <p>So after assembly we did awards, and I got the awards for the highest average in ELA (97, not the highest but one of, tied with ykw girl), math (HIGHEST), and social studies (100!!!! HIGHEST). I was in the background of 2 pictures on the slideshow out of the 112 presented. Wow!</p>
    <p>We went back to homeroom for a few minutes, skipped science and went to ELA where I played ABCya and made things. Wow. Can't believe I enjoyed that as a child.</p>
    <p>At math, we ate ramen and went on our phones.</p>
    <p>Uhh we finished Newsies in theater and uhhh watched a little more of Hamilton.</p>
