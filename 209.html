    <h4>5/11/23 &#45; 4:51 PM CDT &#45; Mayor</h4>
    <h1>Today was fine.</h1>
    <p>Uhhh social studies, I AM ALMOST FINISHED WITH MY PAPER. I JUST NEED TO ADD ONE OR TWO MORE SENTENCES, THEN WRITE THE WORKS CITED PAGE AND DRAW A COVER.</p>
    <p>In ELA, my teacher kept saying questionable things (I think I forgot to mention that yesterday she said that the Nazis created abortion, which is totally wrong), like she said that Indians are from the Middle East. India is in south Asia in the Indian subcontinent...</p>
    <p>At math, we started a paper airplane competition, and I just tested out both of my planes, and they're okay...I need to make a new one but I don't have blank white paper to pretend that it was my original after all, smh.</p>
    <p>Instead of going to theater for 7th period, the mayor of the city came (and also attorneys from the federal gov came to inspect something IDK), and I asked her how much money she makes, and she said $1,200 a month. Slay girl.</p>
    <p>Uhh RTI just worked on my paper.</p>
    <p>Bye.</p>
