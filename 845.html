    <h4>2/5/25 &#45; 4:53 PM CST &#45; Unit Photo x2</h4>
    <h1>Today was eh.</h1>
    <p>JROTC we did some marching and surprisingly I did...fine???? My column rights were fine??? CJ we did notes. Right after CJ I went to the bathroom and I took too long fiddling with my belt, cursing under my breath, that the bell had rung twice before I started running from the far end of upstairs to the far end of downstairs, yet somehow I made it in time to take our unit photo. No clue how the picture turned out, nor do I care. It's just our entire unit. In Spanish, my teacher explained Affirmative Action and all that. Fun. In Biology we did Savvas stuff.</p>
    <p>bye</p>
