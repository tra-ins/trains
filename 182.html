    <h4>4/14/23 &#45; 4:47 PM CDT &#45; Blookets</h4>
    <h1>Today was...weird...? It was okay, but...um...</h1>
    <p>Assembly, whatever, science, finished crossword and did notes.</p>
    <p>Ok ELA, we did Blookets. Lots of Blookets. Some silly and some class-related. I won one about punctuation IIRC (the chest game) and one about proper and common nouns (solo battle royale). Also, for the rounds of battle royale with teams, I kept getting teamed up with ykw, but we did talk and stuff, so, was weird. Me talking to a few folks during class? Weird.</p>
    <p>Um math, just interpreting graphs again, there was a drill in which I sat next to ykw...</p>
    <p>Theater, we finished watching the rest of the presentations (except one on Monday) and I started making a 4th Kahoot about me (yes, a 4th pop quiz). Also someone from my (hr) class waved at me...crazy...?</p>
    <p>RTI was indeed the usual.</p>
    <p>JTA Day 39; MY MATH TEACHER TOLD ME TO SIGN THE ACCEPTANCE LETTER!! NO!!!</p>
    <p>Bye</p>
