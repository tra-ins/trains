    <h4>5/15/24 &#45; 1:17 PM CDT &#45; AP World Exam</h4>
    <h1>Today was okay.</h1>
    <p>Went to school early and took my AP World exam, leaving school right after I finished. I think I did alright, I mean, the MCQs were really easy and the SAQs were easy as well. I did not write the DBQ and LEQ at a college level but I did actually manage to write 3 pages for the DBQ and 2 pages for the LEQ, so. Good God.</p>
    <p>Bye</p>
