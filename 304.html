    <h4>8/14/23 &#45; 4:50 PM CDT &#45; Sister Birthday</h4>
    <h1>happy happy birthday sister also today sucks</h1>
    <p>JROTC we learned how to fall out and fall in and then threw a ball around, calling peoples' names and then throwing the ball at them. I only threw it once because I was one of the last people for the ball to be thrown at. Algebra was just notes. Culinary Arts we learned math. Theater, I worked a little bit on the play. That's all.</p>
