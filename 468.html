    <h4>1/25/24 &#45; 4:57 PM CST &#45; AJ Trilogy</h4>
    <h1>Today also sucks.</h1>
    <p>In AP World we did more notes. In English we read Cask of Amontillado. In Physical Science we did a Curipod thing. And in JROTC we talked about the universe. And the AJ Trilogy came out today, but I won't get it until next week due to the strike for Palestine.</p>
    <p>yeah that's all for today bye</p>
