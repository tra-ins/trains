    <h4>11/2/22 &#45; 4:57 PM CDT &#45; NO SODA</h4>
    <h1>A Wednesday? I don't know what to say.</h1>
    <p>Social studies notes, science notes, ELA work as always, math was math (SLOPE IS SO EASY STOP WE LEARNED THIS LIKE LAST YEAR AND 2 YEARS AGO), and art was okay. I fixed my painting mistakes by pretending that it was a huge pineapple pizza statue, but I didn't finish coloring! Changed the language of Bing on my school laptop to Albanian (Shqip) as a joke, I guess I'll just keep it like that for a while.</p>
    <p>RTI insane as usual, my social studies teacher said da- you know, I'm not trying to say anything remotely bad here.</p>
    <p>Also they [that teacher] kept trying to get these Hispanic kids to stop opening canned soda and this one girl in my class who kept yelling, "NO SODA!!!!" over and over again and I was DYING.</p>
    <p>Bye, I guess.</p>
