    <h4>9/12/25 &#45; 5:05 PM CDT &#45; Homecoming, Once More</h4>
    <h1>today was okay!</h1> 
    <p>In English class we unfortunately didn't act out the end of Act 3 of The Crucible, but we did finish reading it. I helped my friend with her quiz and heard some egregious things. In AV I worked on my speech. In Algebra we did a test. And in 4th block for 40 minutes a camera continuously flashed because the homecoming kids were getting their pictures taken, and it was noisy, and people had to sit by me, and I was irritated because I couldn't get my speech done. I hate pep rallies. I hate homecoming. I don't want anything to come home.</p>
    <p>bye bye</p>
