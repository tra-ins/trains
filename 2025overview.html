    <h4>1/1/26 &#45; 9:47 PM CST &#45; 2025: A Year in Review</h4>
    <h1>2025 was... not as bad as 2024 but I guess it was kind of... hm....I fail to describe how 2025 was. It sure was a year. I would say I was focused on too many things towards the end but I still am. I don't remember much. I don't really have any key moments from that year. I was kind of grieving. I'm so dry I have no thoughts about anything</h1>
    <p>Best parts of 2025? Ummmm. Persona/Megaten in general fixation!!!!! The whole law school thing over the summer was definitely not the best part but I got $250 in gift card form and used it to buy stuff to mod my Wii which I found, which was good. No wait. Modding my 3ds was probably the best part of this year. I got a TV too! Oh oh oh I finished reading TVC series early this year!! Yay. AND AND and AV class and my friend in my English class!!!! I hope we're still friends in spite of being in different classes 2nd semester :(</p>
    <p>Worst parts were school as usual, falling out with even more friends, not being able to sleep again, the debacle over my DE class, and not being able to remember much. Or I guess I don't remember much because there hasn't been many things worth remembering. But there WAS a lot of good this year. Ah, whatever, I've spent too long typing. My New Years resolution is to remember things!!!! Just kidding.</p>
    <p>Maybe 2027 will be my year! Hey, I graduate next year!</p>
    <p>Fourth year of this website complete. Third full year. Once again, why do I even do this anymore? RIP NSS o7</p>
