    <h1>today sucks</h1>
    <p>In JROTC we watched some video and did a PowerPoint about courtesy or whatever. In Algebra, we had a catch up day so I just played TRD. In Culinary, I finished everything so I played TRD again. And in theater, we had a sub, and had to do this group project, that I didn't do because I was clueless and my group didn't group, so ermmm I might fail the class for real this time! Also while I was in the bathroom successfully preventing myself from crying, I ended up stumbling across someone from my old class last year. Great.</p>
    <p>bye.</p>
