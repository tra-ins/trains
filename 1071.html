    <h4>9/19/25 &#45; 5:03 PM CDT &#45; The Crucible (1996)</h4>
    <h1>today was decent</h1> 
    <p>In English we started watching The Crucible (1996). Man. I don't like it that much. Why not the 1967 TV adaptation of The Crucible, or hell, the 2014 Old Vic (?) production? Whatever. In AV Production there was a very uncomfortable chair where I sat. I looked around and thought: my crush always arrives late, so I could just take her seat. So I did. I told my friend, "Do you think our dear classmate would mind?" and he said no, and I said "yeah, I'm sure she won't mind" and hastily switched seats. It was a success. She said nothing. OK maybe her saying nothing was actually not good, at least for me. But still. I was comfortable again. To her possible detriment. Sooorrryyyyy. Anyway, in Algebra we played Radical Bingo! We got through 4 problems I believe in like 40/50 minutes, so my teacher ended up calling out the answers instead. I won! I got 2 bags of chips! In 4th block I played Pokemon Ranger 2 :)</p>
    <p>bye!</p>
