    <h4>8/6/24 &#45; 2:07 PM CDT &#45; The First (Worst) Day of School</h4>
    <h1>Today was comically terrible.</h1>
    <p>There are so many things I have to say about today. I am definitely not pasting what I told my BFF. I woke up at 5:30 (1 hour earlier than last year may I add) and I got dressed, whatever, and my bus is supposed to come at like 6:49. But. My intended bus was out of service so they had to get a substitute bus, so the bus came at like around 7:10/7:20. Fun! Now, let's start the actual school day with Homeroom! Homeroom wasn't terrible, went to a pep rally and it was loud and annoying but it wasn't bad BUT THE BOOK I WAS READING HAD LIKE… NOT APPROPRIATE SCENES AND LIKE I KNEW THE BOOK HAD THEM BUT THERE WAS SO MANY AND I HAD TO SCROLL THROUGH AND TRY TO COVER MY SCREEN. FUN! Next! Criminal Justice. Upon arriving in Criminal Justice I saw someone who looked familiar but I had the benefit of the doubt I knew who they were. In my head I was as hoping Her (Her as in that one girl from the eighth grade y'all can read the older updates for some lore abt Her) was not there. I didn't think She would be but I had a gut feeling. Imagine my surprise when the teacher said Her name. The coincidence is so. We both had Culinary together last year but we ended up being in Criminal Justice together this year. I don't even know how or why they keep putting us together but okay weird coincidence! Next was Geometry and it wasn't bad. I'm not good at Geometry itself though so. Also there's someone who I share 3/4 classes with this semester, we've always had a mutual class each semester since last year but I like them so it's fine.</p> 
    <p>Oh, English. The teacher ignored me but the question I had was answered later on and I wasn't at the wrong class! And when I came back to my seat after asking her and I saw that someone stole my seat??? With my backpack on it??? So I moved to another seat and that person who stole my seat ended up being in the wrong class. But then I felt something so I checked. My period started. In the middle of the school day! Spanish. The worst people I knew from 2 years ago were there. Two jerks (quite literally one of them said "Where's [deadname] at???” And he immediately recognized me????). Moving on, my teacher worked at a prison and he was saying how saggy jeans meant you were open to gay (he said homosexual btw) activities which was something you could tell a class of high school students! And he had like a video on about opening your third eye and heart chakra and like I don't really mind that's cool and all but then at the end of class he started showing us a video about how to break out of the Matrix and it was as bad as you may think. The video kept going on about taking the red or blue pill or something. I went to the theater and AXELSTRADE1!!!!!!! THERE WAS AXELSTRADE!!!!! But then I missed my bus and I had to walk all the way to the front office in my bloody shorts and try to find my parent. I still have drum lessons later today btw!</p> 
    <p>Goodbye folks!</p>
