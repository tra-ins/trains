    <h4>2/13/25 &#45; 4:57 PM CST &#45; El Aeropuerto</h4>
    <h1>Today was ok.</h1>
    <p>In JROTC we watched some Tuskegee Airmen movie, I don't know, I started reading Merrick. CJ we had a sub and did the exact same assignment we've done twice (?) before. Then I rewatched IWTV s1e7 and read more of Merrick after. In Spanish we worked a bit on our presentation and did I game where we were split in halves of the room and had to be the first to write down Spanish words from our new ch. 1 vocab correctly. I haven't seen the vocab for this chapter but I do know that el aeropuerto is the airport! My side of the room won. In Biology we did a benchmark and some work.</p>
