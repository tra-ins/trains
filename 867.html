    <h4>2/27/25 &#45; 4:56 PM CST &#45; I Shot an Air Rifle</h4>
    <h1>Today was okay.</h1> 
    <p>In JROTC we shot air rifles. I have never shot an air rifle until today. It was nauseating yet I liked it yet sort of hated it. It's awe-inspiring. I think my shots were okay for a first-timer standing up. In CJ we did notes and I rewatched s2e1 of IWTV. In Spanish, I read and then did some lessons in the workbook. My substitute teacher mentioned Yellowjackets and I got to discuss it with her a little, which was fun. In Biology we did notes and work. I hate Savvas so much.</p>
