    <h4>9/4/24 &#45; 4:54 PM CDT &#45; The Blood</h4>
    <h1>Today was not great.</h1>
    <p>In Criminal Justice we did a test and learned about testing for DUIs and stuff. In Geometry we learned about reflections again. In English we read more of F451 and now we have to do an argumentative essay! At least the topic isn't that bad. Also spoiler alert Montag literally just burns Beatty, the other firemen, and the Mechanical Hound to death, so that's fun. Spanish class I realized that I was down with a case of The Blood instead of The Fluid, so I bled through every seat I sat on. Sorry teachers, theater people, lunch people, and bus driver. Also we started doing verb conjugation and we did a Gimkit.</p>
    <p>yeah bye.</p>
