    <h4>10/17/22 &#45; 7:44 PM CDT &#45; Guilt?</h4>
    <h1>Mondays suck, but at least they're not Tuesday!</h1>
    <p>Wait, I'll explain the title--</p>
    <p>In English class, my teacher called on me and I'd previously said that the creature 	&#91;Frankenstein&#93; was sad, and they were like, &quot;what else might the creature be feeling&quot; or something like that and I went silent then was like, &quot;uhhhh...he's crying--&quot;. But they interrupted and said something about what a sociopath wouldn't feel &#91;obviously didn't say that verbatim&#93;, and I was still confused&#63;&#63;&#63; AFTER THEY TOLD ME IT WAS GUILT, THEN SAID IT A FEW TIMES AFTER...</p>
    <p>Anyway, today was pretty good for a MONDAY. Ok, but art class sounds boring once again but I shouldn't be that quick to dread it...or should I? I mean it's art class and I have no talent for anything drawing or painting or whatever related...oh yeah, and I have ONE algebraic expression as math homework. Really math teacher? They really said they'd give out homework often or something like that, and still barely does? Ok well I'm not complaining, I despise math but I like my math teacher!!!! All of my teachers are great, actually!!!</p>
