    <h4>1/15/25 &#45; 5:01 PM CST &#45; Oops, I Wore the Improper Uniform</h4>
    <h1>Today was another very bad day.</h1>
    <p>In JROTC I wore the wrong uniform, as the title states. And then I proceeded to embarrass myself so heavily during our practice for a unit-wide inspection next week, because we have to do the 30 step drill sequence in front of a ton of people. A TON OF PEOPLE WILL SEE ME SUFFER AND FAIL. All of those heathens in my JROTC class were grinning, I'm sure. I did bring home my service dress coat though!!! Anyway, in CJ, we talked about corrections and security. In Spanish, we did workbook work and I got the notification about Lucy Dacus's new album releasing soon, titled, "Forever is a Feeling". Boy was I (and I still am) excited. Ankles and Limerence are sooo good such pretty songs Lucy Dacus is so pretty I love her and her music so much please please please can someone buy me tickets I'd ask my mom but she's really mad at me and she probably won't like the album cover-- Moving on. In Biology, we did some group thing, but I didn't join a group, so I didn't do it. Folks, if your uniform lacks a name tag (say, you've just gotten your OCPs), don't wear it. Wear your blues.</p>
    <p>bye</p>
