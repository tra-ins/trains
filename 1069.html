    <h4>9/17/25 &#45; 4:56 PM CDT &#45; Speech Presentations are on Monday, NOT Today...</h4>
    <h1>today was fine save the fact i was stressed out about my speech</h1> 
    <p>In English we acted out some of Act 4 (I was Parris) as I yapped about my speech. In AV I yapped aboiut my speech and tried practicing outside, and we were put into groups to do a horror/thriller/suspense film contest. Great. I don't like horror much. Algebra we learned about radicals and exponents and this is actually hurting my brain and I also have homework. Speech we learned about delivery and rated speeches and stuff.</p>
