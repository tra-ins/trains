    <h4>3/18/23 &#45; 8:22 PM CDT &#45; Trolley</h4>
    <h1>Spring Break, I guess.</h1>
    <p>I don't know, we were supposed to explore on a trolley but I woke up late and didn't feel like going, lol. At least my mom found a white collared shirt.</p>
    <p>Rizz Status: I think I've received full enough confirmation that my crush is indeed dating that guy that I heard was dating them like a month or 2 ago. Still no rizz tho, lol.</p>
    <p>JTA Day 12.</p>
    <p>Bye.</p>
