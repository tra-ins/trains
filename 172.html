    <h4>4/4/23 &#45; 5:21 PM CDT &#45; Bullying???</h4>
    <h1>Today sucked.</h1>
    <p>Uhhh I forgot to finish my social studies map during homeroom. I literally just forgot about it. Oops??? Anyway, someone kept bothering me and saying how people were...bullying me?? Girl (they were a guy) WHAT? SINCE WHEN? I JUST GET IGNORED AND LAUGHED AT EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE, BUT NOT FULL ON BULLYING? Also I heard them say something about my suits and ties like girl I'll just continue to wear them hahahaha!!!</p>
    <p>In science, I am presented today with many instances of possible racism and/or stereotyping and my teacher trying to disprove evolution. My science teacher doesn't believe in evolution, and my entire class agreed with him...????? AND ALSO PEOPLE STARTED LIKE...FIGHTING??? THEY WERE WRESTLING ON THE GROUND AND EVERYONE WAS JUST SAYING THAT NOTHING HAPPENED WHEN THE SCIENCE TEACHER CAME BACK, SO I DON'T THINK HE KNEW???? I'M SHOCKED AND CONFUZZLED.</p>
    <p>ELA!!! Unit test, not that bad actually? Well, the final few questions were semi difficult, but the questions about the actual book were...EASY???</p>
    <p>Math math math haha we didn't get to go outside because everyone was being bad bad and my teacher spent most of class being mad at us</p>
    <p>Uhh theater had to go to PE; PE + extra PE = 1+ hour of sitting alone and being bothered by those around me! I hope the person who said I got a 20/20 on that ELA unit test from today wasn't lying, because they are someone who'd bother me :)</p>
    <p>ok that's all?</p>
    <p>JTA Day 29; god only knows if it can continue due to the acceptance letter</p>
    <p>bye</p>
