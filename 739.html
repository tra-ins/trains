    <h4>10/22/24 &#45; 5:19 PM CDT &#45; I Got Another Letter from My Friend</h4>
    <h1>Criminal Justice we learned more about firearm safety. Geometry we did triangles stuff. English we started our first body paragraph. I actually was able to finish my thesis, and I showed it to my teacher and she made no edits and told me I was a very talented writer and she asked me if I liked to write or if I was just good at it. I shook my head. I walked back over to my seat, and I did finish my first body paragraph during Spanish class. In Spanish we had a sub so I finished my first body paragraph for my English essay, watched The Addams Family, and read more of TQOTD.</h1>
