    <h4>10/14/24 &#45; 4:47 PM CDT &#45; Um, What?</h4>
    <h1>I got asked invasive questions today! And I woke up at 4 am because I was really itchy and I couldn't go back to sleep for the same reason. So I've been awake for 12 hours! Today was terrible.</h1>
    <p>Today during Criminal Justice I decided to finally use the journal my mom got for me Freshman year, so these updates may be more accurate, since they are more written closer to the moment. In Criminal Justice we did Unit 17 notes, which was about ethics and codes of ethics and all that. I didn't do the assignment because we had to replace the code of ethics for a local corrections office with the job we wanted. But I don't know what job I want to do. So, I just read more of The Queen of the Damned. In Geometry we learned about dilations. A guy who I don't remember ever seeing before sat in front of me and tried to get my attention a few times. If you know me, you know I hate to entertain people who do that, it never feels as if it's in good faith (and from past experiences it's never in good faith), so I said nothing. I just glanced a bit. However, later on, he started debating with the guy who sat across from him, who recognized me as a student (we'd never interacted though. I don't know him) about my gender. He was like "that's a guy (or dude I forgot what exactly)", and the other guy was like "she's a girl". It made me very uncomfortable. I tried not to react, I just wanted to finish my homework. The guy I didn't know was pretty funny when he wasn't being invasive, and I tried not to laugh. I recall him asking me, and I quote, word for word, verbatim, "Do you have a coochie?". Um, What? The other guy told him I was smart (lie) and he sraered calling me "wisdom" and I couldn't help but laugh. I ran off to homeroom for OT afterwards, did not finish my homework because I had to see the guidance to prepare to take the PSAT tomorrow. I did not know the PSAT was tomorrow because I never check my email. Oops! Anyway, in English, I did do the assignment, but there was a writing portion I couldn't think of an answer to so I just read TQOTD. I learned Spanish in Spanish class. I don't know what else to say. And then I read and discussed DG&DP with my gf while waiting for the bus and while on the bus and off the bus.</p>
