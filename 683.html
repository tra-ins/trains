    <h4>8/27/24 &#45; 4:36 PM CDT &#45; Clarisse Died?</h4>
    <h1>Today was okay.</h1>
    <p>Criminal Justice I went to the guidance counselor's office because my mom made me sign up to take the PSAT. We did a Kahoot that day. Geometry we did review of concepts from the 6th or 7th grade. English we did a quick write about "ignorance is bliss" and read more of Fahrenheit 451. RIP Clarisse :( In Spanish class we did a Gimkit and vocab stuff.</p>
    <p>yep bye</p>
