    <h4>8/11/23 &#45; 4:52 PM CDT &#45; Dumb Teenager Cries on the FIFTH Day of High School</h4>
    <h1>I hate my life.</h1>
    <p>Homeroom nothing to talk about once again, JROTC sucked because I have no friends and nobody wanted to be my partner to pick up trash around the outside of the school, so I cried and walked next to one of the instructors. Also, I'm screwed once we do actual PT instead of just the stretches. How do I get out of JROTC before it's too late? Whatever, Algebra was kind of boring, 7th grade review at this point. In Culinary Arts, we just talked about the syllabus and got sized for the chef coats (xs btw). Theater we had a sub again, and we have MORE WORK that I'm going to procrastinate on because I don't want to write a report about a play nor write a one act play. These guys kept shaking my desk and screaming very close to my ears, this is why I hate men (still trying to figure out if I'm NB or FTM but STILL). That's all, I guess.</p>
    <p>By the way, happy 300th update! I just hung up that Heathers poster finally, and my sister left today. RAHHH USA USA USA...semi-hiatus over!</p>
    <p>Bye.</p>
