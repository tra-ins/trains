    <h4>1/7/25 &#45; 6:17 PM CST &#45; I Don't Even Know Where to Begin, Holy Crap</h4>
    <h1>Today was a handful.</h1>
    <p>I could not sleep until 3 am. I struggled to get out of bed. I read in Homeroom. New classes! JROTC III! One person I did not want to see. I read for a bit, then my teacher asked me what I was reading and I showed him Vittorio the Vampire. And he started talking about Anne Rice and Interview with the Vampire. Lovely. I was very nervous. Then I go to Criminal Justice. Teacher blabs on about things I have already been aware of and I spend the entire class reading. I dread what is to come in CJ II. Then SPANISH. I have that one teacher who subbed for us. And she terrified me. Strict as always. And I saw TWO people I did not want to see again. So I was EXTREMELY nervous. Went to C Lunch. People swarmed the table I usually sat at. I felt terrible. When I got back from lunch, my teacher asked me to step aside with her outside. And she asked me, she asked me. SHE ASKED ME. She asked me, "Are you trans?" I was already very nervous and this put me into a shock. I did not know what to say. I asked her who told her, and she said some kid(s) was/were transvestigating me. Great. When she asked me what I preferred to go by, I said, not thinking, "I don't care." Didn't feel like outing myself to a teacher I didn't know. I don't remember the more specific details. In Biology we talked about lab safety and did an icebreaker worksheet. It was boring. And the class was stuffed up. What a boring, nervous experience.</p>
    <p>bye bye</p>
