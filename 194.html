    <h4>4/26/23 &#45; 4:53 PM CDT &#45; TCAP Day 7 - Obscure</h4>
    <h1>TCAP Part 7; Both subparts of science done. Today was okay.</h1>
    <p>The science TCAP was so hard, I think I failed. But you know who else failed? My science teacher. He sucks. Oh, we'll get back to science later ;)</p>
    <p>After the TCAPs we finished watching Brother Bear and then went to ELA, where I just played Punch Out on my laptop the entire time. Though after lunch, silly classmates kept calling my name. Said nothing, obviously.</p>
    <p>At math, the teacher made us answer a question which was literally impossible because it didn't say the shepherd's age. I wrote '-15' as a joke but scribbled it, so when the teacher came by he looked at my paper for a minute and said, "I got the same thing" or something along those lines. I was technically correct though. There wasn't an answer. Also someone in my class asked him if he was Amish, and then the conversation devolved into that annoying kid from Tuesday April 18th saying how he would want to be buried on a WWE ring or something. What.</p>
    <p>Went to science after math and we have to write a 12 page paper about a topic we choose randomly. I got the Trail of Tears, a quite interesting topic, but very depressing (and easy tbf), so I asked the teacher for something more "obscure", but he was like "what" and the kids around me were confused and giggling. Girl bye. I changed the wording to say "more hard" and he was like "no". Not a bad topic tho, I'll take it.</p>
    <p>After was RTI and Kahoot was having issues so we just did a Blooket on Teams, but I think I was the only one who did it. Wow, ok. That's pretty much it.</p>

    <p>Bye</p>
