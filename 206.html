    <h4>5/8/23 &#45; 4:51 PM CDT &#45; "REAGAN BUSH '87"??</h4>
    <h1>Today was ok, I guess.</h1>
    <p>Back at school after missing the 4th & 5th, and I missed the bus. I woke up at 7:17 AM, no way I would've made it. Oops. Sorry parent.</p>
    <p>Uhh social studies, I have a 99 instead of a 100 now because I got a couple wrong on the webquest??? I'm so stupid :(((</p>
    <p>Uhh ELA more Space Race, my teacher knows who made the accounts but they haven't turned themself in...also apparently someone in my class got into a fight on Thursday or Friday, and they're suspended. What.</p>
    <p>In math, uhh we continued the riddle thing, and the girls are mad at me because I didn't say any of my correct answers...LLLLLLLL skill issue</p>
    <p>Near the end of math class, we went to watch Mean Girls Jr., the musical but family friendly. Before it started, the guy who told me how he was in Jan 6th (I'm American!!!) told me "REAGAN BUSH 87". 87? Were there even any elections in 87? Reagan's second term ended in 1989, I believe. OMG LIKE HEATHERS!!!! Also, people were yelling at me to scoot down, but I couldn't hear, and the guy I used to be friends with tapped me a couple times and got in trouble and had to sit away. LOL.</p>
    <p>You know, their production of Mean Girls (Jr) was actually pretty decent. Janis was hot, everything was in line. The person playing Damian understood the assignment ong. After, the hypocrite guy who was sitting behind me, asked if the guy I used to be friends with was my bf. Everyone thought I was about to smack him, lol (I didn't). He then asked me if I was racist. Why he calls me racist whenever I'm brought up is beyond me.</p>
    <p>Yay, no extra PE bye.</p>
    <p>bye.</p>
