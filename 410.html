    <h4>11/28/23 &#45; 4:36 PM CST &#45; Drums</h4>
    <h1>In JROTC, we didn't really do anything because there's testing, so we just sat there until like 11 something (CRUSH SAT IN FRONT OF  ME!!!!). In Algebra, we didn't really do anything. In Culinary, we did a pop quiz. And in theater, I forgot what we did. I guess I'm taking drum lessons now--yesterday, this girl who I met at the band place complimented my shirt (she was so pretty btw totally not slightly crushing), but she also didn't know who Mitski is, so ermmmmm--at least my mom got me a Mitski shirt for participating!!!</h1>
    <p>Bye</p>
