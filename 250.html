    <h4>6/21/23 &#45; 10:44 PM CDT &#45; The Eye Surgery</h4>
    <h1>This was written on 6/21, however 6/22-6/26 were written on 6/27. Sowwy my sibling stayed in my room so I just binged TikTok in bed.</h1>
    <p>Had the most painful ride to and fro the hospital. Idk why I just felt dastardly ailing. Went in the wrong building and then I immediately panicked about the IV (needle…) when we got to the hospital bed. Lots of talking and I even got a birthday gift from the hospital since my birthday is in a few days. I had to listen to Heathers: The Musical music to even remotely calm down for the IV and it didn’t even go in properly the first time. I cried real tears that day. I actually have a list of every song that played while I had earbuds in. The doctor ppl asked me what I was listening to and my mom OUTED ME FOR LISTENING TO HEATHERS. Also I really said “see you on the other side” and said that it’s a HAMILTON REFERENCE to the docs. Ok but after all that I fell asleep very quickly. I don’t even remember what happened before or how I did. It just happened and I miraculously woke up a while later to blurry, painful vision, being confused as to where I am. I swear to god the moments right before and after surgery are the most painful feelings one could ever have in life. My eye just leaks blood now I guess and my sister is coming home sometime and I have to wake up at random intervals to take medication and put in gel or something. I got McDonald’s tho but for a while my mouth was super dry and I could barely eat or DRINK anything without choking except the GOAT RAMENNNN. Ignoring the fact that the ride fro involved extreme pain and a few stops because of how sick i felt. Worst experience do not ever get strabismus correcting surgery. Happy summer tho.</p>
    <p>bye</p>
