    <h4>12/5/23 &#45; 4:23 PM CST &#45; Egg Yolk</h4>
    <h1>today mid</h1>
    <p>In JROTC, we learned about etiquette. In Algebra, we did part 2 of the EOCs. In Culinary, we made mayo, and I failed to separate the egg yolk and got it all over my hands, and then was schooled by Chef on how to do it. Wow, I'm such a great cook! And in theater, we started our final project.</p>
