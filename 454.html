    <h1>today eh</h1>
    <p>In AP World, we talked about South and Southeast Asia. In English, we finished reading The Necklace. In Physical Science, we watched a video about lab safety. And in JROTC, we talked about the origins of the world or something. If I had a nickel for how many times I had an old white guy as a teacher who told us that we might get offended over evolutionism vs creationism, I'd have two nickels...HELPPPPPPPPPP</p>
