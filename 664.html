    <h1>Today was okay? Eh.</h1>
    <p>Criminal Justice I wrote down personal information and put my fingerprints on a paper. Geometry we did an easy review sheet. English we had to write and it was annoying. And Spanish, we talked, and I learned that my teacher is probably transphobic! Learned some colors and shapes in a Gimkit though.</p> 
    <p>that's all folks! did i mention i love boygenius okay bye</p>
