    <h4>1/8/24 &#45; 4:42 PM CST &#45; I'm Doomed This Semester</h4>
    <h1>today SUCKEDDD</h1>
    <p>In AP World, my new homeroom/1st period, I slowly learned that it was a mistake. I hate writing. In English, I saw...people from last year...and I liked the teacher at least! I don't like writing though. Or reading. AND WE HAVE TO DO THE OUTSIDERS AND ROMEO AND JULIET THIS YEAR???? I ALREADY DID THOSE YEARS BEFORE IN SCHOOL?? I have A lunch first. Good God (omg Rio Romeo reference...). In Physical Science, we did like sort of icebreakers thing, and it was just annoying. And in JROTC...we didn't really do anything...but...I saw PEOPLE from last year...ughhhhhh...</p>
    <p>Finished reading every Sergeant Cribb novel today though! I love the series so muchhhhh!!!!</p>
    <p>bye...</p>
