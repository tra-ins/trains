    <h4>2/6/25 &#45; 4:55 PM CST &#45; This is the Girl's Restroom</h4>
    <h1>Today was ok.</h1>
    <p>JROTC we watched more of Interstellar (again). CJ we went to the other teacher's classroom because the eighth graders came in to tour the school, and while I was reading, I heard the most familiar voice. And I immediately jerked my head around and saw my 8th grade English teacher. Thank goodness she didn't recognize me, or that if she did, she didn't say anything. Another occurance was going to the bathroom and someone telling me that, "this is the girls' restroom". No shit. See Tennessee Accommodations for All Children Act for why I was using the girls' restroom. Moving on, in Spanish class, we went over verbs like gustar. Oops! I should probably work on my essay and my project! I won't. In Biology we did work and notes.</p>
