    <h4>4/29/24 &#45; 4:47 PM CDT &#45; Projects & Tests</h4>
    <h1>Today was mid.</h1>
    <p>AP World did notes. English did escape room and this is exactly a repeat of 7th grade. I have to do a group project, doing something similar to the solo Outsiders project I did in that year. Help me. Science made an atom model and got cookies. JROTC I have to do my 30 step drill sequence test tomorrow, and PT test Thursday, and other stuff. Ugh.</p>
    <p>bye</p>
