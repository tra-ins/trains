    <h4>9/27/23 &#45; 4:29 PM CDT &#45; Laptop Issues (& Fall Break)</h4>
    <h1>So...my mom's laptop has a burn spot.</h1>
    <p>And the laptop runs slowly. I am not rich, I cannot get a new one. And I don't believe that there's a way for me to update all of this on mobile. So, if the website doesn't update for a while (other then Fall Break stuff), it's because of that. I apologize.</p>
