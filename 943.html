    <h4>5/14/25 &#45; 4:50 PM CDT &#45; WHEN WILL THIS BE OVERRRR</h4>
    <h1>Today was ok x2.</h1> 
    <p>In JROTC I turned in my boots and watched some of Karate Kid in the other classroom while playing on my 3DS. In CJ we did notes? I thought we had finished the last of them but whatever. In Spanish we did some work. In Biology we finished our frog dissection models and I'm pretty sure tomorrow is the strawberry DNA lab day.</p>
    <p>bye</p>
