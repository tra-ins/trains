    <h4>1/22/23 &#45; 5:40 PM CST &#45; 100th Update</h4>
    <h1>Yay 100th update/100th or 99th day I don't even know at this point since technically the first update was on October 15th 2022, but 100 days ago was the 14th, help.</h1>
    <p>Ok time to cry about my 91 in ELA because I got 2 75s and a 85 on solos in the English Language Arts and I am quite indeed fuming over this predicament since I disdain all activies within writing or reading in the English language. Let it be known, Mrs. ____, my sworn enemy! Thou must payest for thy mistakes!</p>
    <p>help (bye)</p>
