    <h4>2/21/23 &#45; 5:20 PM CST &#45; Beta Meeting</h4>
    <h1>Today sucks</h1>
    <p>Social studies- extremely easy open note quiz, got 100 and also added a railroad to the factory MC server!!!</p>
    <p>ELA itself was cool as always, but my teacher complimented my vest a couple times but then asked and was confused about why (near the beginning and end of class) I applied for the magnet* (it isn't a magnet school but I'm not doxxing that school!!!) school. Remember how my parents made me do it? Yeah that's what I told her. SHE WAS GENUINELY SUPER CONFUSED AND SHE TOLD ME NOT TO SHRUG WHEN SHE ASKED. I'm not going in-depth, so really, the A in STEAM is Arts, which I am also barely interested in, so there's no way I'd want to do that school...like why when I could just do advanced classes (that I don't even want to do, except APUSH or any other AP class concerning social studies ofc ofc). Lunch itself was okay though, but my friend was confused on what I meant by 'wife' so I just told him that it was a joke and that I'm definitely straight!!!</p>
    <p>Uhh math was math; it sucked because math sucks and angles suck.</p>
    <p>PE was...well...7th period went as usual, you know how it is, boringly waiting, though some girl asked if I was ok and I was like 'sure'...but 8th period...was the same except that the English teacher (from ELA) was there for someone or something!!!! I was like "oh boy, I sure hope ____ doesn't intrude into my secluded area--STOP", because she proceeded to ask if I was waiting (since the area I go to is near the bathroom door) and I just told her it was my hiding place. Said a few things about THAT SAME PREVIOUS SCHOOL and sounded angry in tone...that lady still scares me!!! I'm sorry if you read this ____, but I'd rather call someone anonymous lady than their actual name on the internet :)) and also I'm scared of EVERY teacher. Even the social studies teacher. And my elementary teachers.</p>
    <p>Beta meeting- Had no clue where it was but my friend was correct somehow??? It was in the cafeteria!!! I went there and was super confused and sat alone. We played north and south (boring easy questions), and then they proceeded to go on and on about fundraisers, this service thing we're doing in like March, and the reward party (which is May 10th during school). Since 5 bags of candy/1 jumbo bag counts as 5 hours, and you have to add a bit of variety, I'll just give one jumbo bag of candy for the service event and help with the cleanup. Sounds simple and easy enough. Got Dunkin' after.</p>
    <p>Bye.</p>
