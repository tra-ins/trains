    <h4>11/27/23 &#45; 4:54 PM CST &#45; Leaks</h4>
    <h1>In JROTC, we did some thing or something, I forgot, but I did pass the promotion test!!! I'm an Airman First Class now. In Algebra, we did more EOC pracice. In Culinary, we did this worksheet, and I watched episode 1 of season 2 of the Total Drama reboot because someone leaked it ("RAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!" - Millie). I forgot what we did in theater because I didn't pay attention. Also my mom's forcing me to do a drum lesson today.</h1>
