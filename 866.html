    <h4>2/26/25 &#45; 4:58 PM CST &#45; I Just Kept Doing Things</h4>
    <h1>Today was eh.</h1> 
    <p>In JROTC we marched outside and everyone was so incompetent that I kept laughing. In CJ we did a test and I started writing a short story. In Spanish we did this pyramid game in which one says words in English that the other has to say in Spanish for our chapter 1 vocab. I did poorly because 1. my pronunciation is not great and 2. I haven't memorized the new vocab that well. In Biology we did notes and some work.</p>
    <p>bye</p>
