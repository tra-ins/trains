    <h4>3/27/23 &#45; 6:33 PM CDT &#45; Eye Specialist</h4>
    <h1>Today was fine. I stayed up last...morning until 3 AM playing The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles. I beat Adventures!! Wait Resolve--</h1>
    <p>Ok umm wearing peach collared shirt and jeans; cool beans! Homeroom was okay, uhh social studies just a map and text, easy, whatever, 4th quarter time!!!</p>
    <p>In ELA, my teacher was spouting very epic inaccurate geopolitical information! I am sorry to inform you, my teacher of the English Language Arts, but Japan is not socialist. Also I got 198/200 on the recent PowerPoint slides because I followed the rubric; all I have to do now is 8-11!!! I and ykw girl did the best or something, according to the teacher, hahahahahahahaha.</p>
    <p>Lunch, I was first in line to leave and whilst in line the teacher started complimenting me and my outfit and stuff, she was asking if I went to the store, and saying something about confidence, I dunno, something about a businesswoman.</p>
    <p>In math, I left early at around 1:05 PM (supposed to be 1) and went to the car, was informed of the shooting in Nashvile (very epic thanks mom for saying at least we went to a specific different town instead of Nashville; also the lady at the secure entrance was just talking to her about the shooting), and headed to the eye place.</p>
    <p>Went to the eye place, told my sister "garden shears", and waited in the waiting room. Got examined and stuff by the doctor lady, EYE DROPS, and went back. Waited a bit, mom talked to a bunch of ladies, and got examined further by a doctor guy. Also uhh umm surgery or something whatever already knew, 20/15 vision, whatever, McDonald's yummy, THE EYE DROPS WERE SO ANNOOOYYIYIYNYN I HATE EYE DRIOS GRRRR.</p>
    <p>JTA Day 21; god only knows if it can continue due to the acceptance letter</p>
    <p>bye.</p>
