    <h4>10/10/24 &#45; 0:00 AM CDT &#45; Left the USVI</h4>
    <h1>Said goodbye to the rest of my family, went on a plane from St. Thomas (the TSA agent searched like... my groin but that's a whole other kinda traumatizing story) to Ft. Lauderdale (Hurricane Milton didn't touch us, thankfully. I hope the people in FL are doing well though). We had to stay at the airport for like 6 hours, so we wandered around and got food (yummy bagels!). I watched clips of Julien and Lucy and listened to Lucy's discog, rewatched episode 4 of IWTV, played Pokemon Masters, and looked at the art all around the airport. I played Pokemon Scarlet the entire plane ride home, and I was super nauseous on the Uber ride home. But I'm home now!</h1>
    <p>Bye</p>
