    <h4>10/24/23 &#45; 4:35 PM CDT &#45; Moles</h4>
    <h1>today was okay</h1>
    <p>In JROTC, we carved pumpkins. In Algebra, we did more stuff. In Culinary, we're going to make playdough tomorrow. Great. Right before lunch, I started doing this mole scavenger hunt thing, and I don't think I'll get all of them by Thursday, but I still hope I win. In theater, I worked on my project more.</p>
    <p>bye</p>
