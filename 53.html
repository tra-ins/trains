    <h4>12/6/22 &#45; 4:46 PM CST &#45; Capulet</h4>
    <h1>Pretty good day, still coughing though.</h1>
    <p>Science was a test that was kind of dumb?? LIke, someone of it we never learned or was just plain dumb. ELA was Romeo and Juliet acting, math was the Benchmark, art was Hour of Code, and RTI was RTI.</p>
    <p>So in ELA, we acted out Scene V Act 1 of Romeo and Juliet, where Romeo crashes the Capulet party and meets Juliet. I wanted some lines or at least to be a musician so I can pretend to play an instrument, but I was chosen as...Lady Capulet [Juliet's mom] [Also, yk who (girl) played Juliet, which is funny to think about]. The character without lines. I slayed though, was fun, just wish I got to speak. [Lord] Capulet would've been fun though.</p>
    <p>In RTI I was listening to music (and previously had been playing Starfall and ABCya games on my laptop), and 2 of my classmates thought I was rich and had airpods. So I told them that my earbuds were fake and cost $10 (long story, and they're also from 2020 so I think they work). They were like, "oh at least you were honest". What an experience.</p>
    <p>Bye</p>
