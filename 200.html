    <h4>5/2/23 &#45; 4:57 PM CDT &#45; 200th Update</h4>
    <h1>Today was mid, but happy 200th website update!!!</h1>
    <p>Ok, gave absent notes to the substitute, good. Went to science and did THREE (not finished with the third actually) paragraphs of my very rough draft while people found the science teacher and the math teacher on Snap??? Their users are just their names, but still confused.</p>
    <p>ELA, we did more Space Race. Oh God we might have to write 2 pages about a cosmonaut/astronaut. Hoping we just have to do the final exam.</p>
    <p>Math, EasyCBM or whatever. ELA one. Easy as usual.</p>
    <p>In theater we started watching Mean Girls. Literally the movie uncensored. Very appropriate.</p>
    <p>At extra PE, people from the previous class were just there writing paragraphs (5?) because they didn't do 5 down and backs. My class did the 5 down and backs, and people kept shouting my name, again. I hate all of them.</p>
    <p>Bye</p>
