    <h4>8/1/24 &#45; 1:41 PM CDT &#45; Orientation</h4>
    <h1>UGH</h1>
    <p>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA update after orientarion: Ate at a new taco place, nachos were good. Orientation wasn't that bad, got called young man (/vpos!!!), saw AP World teacher and he asked me if I was proud about my score (a 5), and I said "a bit". I didn't see anyone I knew from 2 years ago iirc, and it was just chill. But I think this year will be difficult. Also I have JROTC second semester only for some reason. And I talked about gender with my mom when I got home, she ordered me tape I think. Or at least I hope she did. And she asked me about dating. Weird.</p> 
    <p>bye.</p>
