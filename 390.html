    <h4>11/8/23 &#45; 4:31 PM CST &#45; Prep</h4>
    <h1>today was okay</h1>
    <p>In JROTC, my instructor told me that he showed my presentation to all the other classes. Great. And we did some inspection stuff. In Algebra, we watched Lord of the Rings. In Culinary, we did prep for Thursday and Friday. And in theater, we did more set stuff.</p>
