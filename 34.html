    <h1>Today was decent.</h1>
    <p>Yeah, a Thursday. As much as I love Thursdays, today could've been better. Social studies was good as always, ELA I did part 2 of the test (did the essay portion, I got over 500 words. Help the minimum was 200), math was math, art was fine, RTI was RTI.</p>
    <p>We get our progress reports for the 2nd quarter tomorrow, I think!!! Yay.</p>
    <p>Scarlet and Violet come out tomorrow ;))))))))))))))</p>
    <p>Okay bye</p>
