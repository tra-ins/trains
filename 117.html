    <h4>2/8/23 &#45; 4:44 PM CST &#45; Beta Ceremony</h4>
    <h1>Today was...mid?</h1>
    <p>Turned in permission slip for field trip first in my class. Homeroom teacher forgot to tell me yesterday where to turn the golden ticket in. I'll bring it again tomorrow. Social studies was fine; I just did the 1812 map assignment and all.</p>
    <p>Science was pretty easy; just vocab illustrations of stuff from yesterday that I did.</p>
    <p>ELA was more cool stuff other than Beta; got a form for the National Beta induction ceremony tomorrow pretty late (something like: "and this is for you!"), please help I'm going to go get something nice to wear.</p>
    <p>Math was math, I guess.</p>
    <p>Art-- actual work was fine but 3 girls from Beta took me and some other girl in and told us about the ceremony; I asked the other girl who came if she willingly did this, and she was silent and didn't reply.</p>
    <p>RTI was RTI and I told my teacher that I was going to get that mini fridge stuffed with $25.</p>
    <p>I'm rushing this, but please help I don't want to do that ceremony, ALSO H SCHOOL FIELD TRIP TOMORROW.</p>
    <p>Bye.</p>
