    <h4>9/18/25 &#45; 5:27 PM CDT &#45; Oreo Truffles, Again a;so happy pokemon bw day yay</h4>
    <h1>today was glorious</h1> 
    <p>In English we finally finished The Crucible and did some assignments, and my friend gave me an Oreo truffle. The last time I had one was a few years ago when I still had the recipe I got from my 7th grade teacher. I was obsessed. I was overjoyed. Ecstatic. Man, having friends is great! And in AV we worked on our project. The Box. In Algebra we did work whatever. And in 4th block I finished my homework, trimmed my speech, and played SMT.</p>
    <p>bye!</p>
