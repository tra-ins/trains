    <h4>4/15/24 &#45; 5:14 PM CDT &#45; Second Mitski Shirt</h4>
    <h1>Today sucks.</h1>
    <p>Went to the science classroom to test. It was an essay. An unnecessarily dificult one. English we did nothing. Science we did nothing. JROTC we flew rockets. And, I got my second Mitski shirt. Fits on me slightly better than the last one, but I'll still wear it.</p>
