    <h4>11/17/25 &#45; 8:27 PM CST &#45; local student has one more day to complete his essay and still hasn't decided on a persuasive speech topic</h4>
    <h1>today was fine</h1> 
    <p>woke up to a message i spent 22 minutes trying to think of a response to. it was a good message though. ahem. anyway i kind of struggled to focus on tjings today because in my mind i kept thinking about that conversation and so i didnt really care about whatever my friend had to say in english (i did read half of chapter 6 of tgg. not all though.) and i think my av project group started planning things out a little without my input because whatever. in algebra we reviewed log problems and all that but i was thinking more about chess really. i was manifesting in fact. because i make blunders in every match i play. anyway in 4th block we uhhh talked about rhetorical stuff? and i wrote a speech from the perspective of the hare in the tortoise in the hare. didn't finish it obviously.</p>
    <p>bye</p>
