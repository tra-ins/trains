    <h4>11/30/22 &#45; 4:36 PM CST &#45; Shutteth Thy Face</h4>
    <h1>Today was fine, 1st Amendment - RAPPS, 2nd Amendment - right to bear arms, 3rd Amendment - no quartering, 4th Amendment - no unreasonable searches, 5th Amendment - due process, 6th Amendment - right to a lawyer, and so on.</h1>
    <p>Social studies fine, science fine, ELA fine (Shakespeare, hence the title of the update, also my ELA teacher told us we should say that. Though she and some of the teachers are the ones full-on swearing and saying things close to that, lol (they don't encourage us to do though)), math was okay (we got donuts again), art was cool, and RTI was RTI.</p>
    <p>At lunch, these guys (who are friends with my only friend) kept throwing aluminum balls at my friend [that friend], until my friend hits his tray and all of his chili? [I don't know, it's school food] Spills all over (including on my sweater's sleeves and my lunchbox!!!). He had to clean it up, but the guys who threw the balls didn't do anything. Yikes.</p>
    <p>RIP Rick the roach, ???-November 29th. His grave is next to the door of the social studies room.</p>
    <p>Today was interesting, I don't know what else to note though.</p>
    <p>Tomorrow is the beginning of December, so I'll have to edit the layout again.</p>
    <p>Bye bye</p>
