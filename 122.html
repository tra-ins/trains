    <h4>2/13/23 &#45; 4:50 PM CST &#45; Chiefs</h4>
    <h1>I knew the Chiefs would win the Super Bowl (I still don't care). Also today was mediocre.</h1>
    <p>Social studies- easy notes and map and stuff. Friend tried stealing my phone but I said something a little mean and snatched it easily.</p>
    <p>ELA, traumatic as usual but still cool and interesting.</p>
    <p>The game of Uno we played at lunch didn't end until we had to leave. This one kid had like the entire deck of cards drawed.</p>
    <p>Uhh math was math, I guess. I HATE ANGLES AND GEOMETRY!!!!</p>
    <p>Went to PE for 7th period, stood outside for 40 minutes staring at the wall, before that some kid kept yelling out to me about some guy (but I ignored them).</p>
    <p>No extra PE, so I just chilled, DIDN'T WIN THE AMAZON GIFT CARD. MY CLASSMATE DID. I'M CRYING.</p>
