    <h4>4/5/23 &#45; 2:50 PM CDT &#45; 20/20 Confirmed</h4>
    <h1>Today is good.</h1>
    <p>Hmmm today in homeroom, I walked in on the people already there having a...conversation. I'm confused and afraid and traumatized???</p>
    <p>So in social studies [A day because 4 day week], we did the ENTIRE Civil War in one day. Yep. And today I learned that my teacher is based??? Also I raised my hand and told her about how I lived near a certain few battles...though I said it right after she had said that the names of those places/battles I lived near were bad or sounded weird or something, I don't feel like checking. And I told her about the school that had to change its name because it was named after...a Confederate general.</p>
    <p>Ok, ELA, I just did vocab because I already finished the PowerPoint slides last week. The teacher told the class that I got a 20/20 on the unit test!!! I think the 2nd highest score was a 14/20, lol. Y'all better be glad that she didn't scale it from my score and instead from the 2nd highest. 100!!! Lol, those folks yesterday were right.</p>
    <p>Math!!! Ok, in math, when I got in the classroom, the teacher told me that I should get into advanced Algebra next year [I chose regular Algebra for context] and do summer school, so he'd teach all of the Algebra stuff early so I'd be girlboss or something like that? He didn't say 'girlboss' but I don't know what he was alluding to. I just told him no, haha, I don't want to suffer during the summer. We left early from math (like an hour ago) because of the weather...but the weather hasn't been bad yet hahahaha!!!!</p>
    <p>yep that's it for today.</p>
    <p>JTA Day 30; god only knows if it can continue due to the acceptance letter</p>
    <p>bye.</p>
