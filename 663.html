    <h4>8/7/24 &#45; 5:12 PM CDT &#45; Well? I Don't Know</h4>
    <h1>Today was meh.</h1>
    <p>Embarrassed myself in Criminal Justice in front of Her because of my impulse to answer any geography and/or map related question. I will not elaborate. Also the teacher talked about himself and his family. Geometry we did an about me sheet I kind of lied on and some number thing where you go in a group of three and circle each number to 100 in 5 minutes, and we didn't get to 100. There was a pattern that I did kind of notice or something. English, we talked and read some passage, and I have B Lunch. Lovely. Spanish. We. Talked! The teacher tried to get us to meditate. Also apparently we're going to use Duolingo heart eyes emoji!</p>
