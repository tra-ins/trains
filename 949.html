    <h4>5/20/25 &#45; 7:54 PM CDT &#45; The Last Day, Actually</h4>
    <h1>Today was ok.</h1> 
    <p>I watched IWTV and read until 3rd block. I got a perfect score on my exam...but I still ended off the year with an 89 in Spanish. Left after. Went to a town an hour away from me and saw a car museum and went to a Half Price Books outlet. I got 9 books, but my head hurts so I'm not going to list them all. I regret not getting The General though. It started hailing so we got Raising Canes and left the area early.</p>
    <p>ok bye! no more school until august!</p>
