    <h4>9/14/23 &#45; 4:38 PM CDT &#45; A Midsummer Night's Dream</h4>
    <h1>today was like kinda okay ig</h1>
    <p>Instead of going to JROTC and Algebra, I went on the field trip to my old school (the magnet school.) (I saw a couple teachers I had at some point last year but they didn't say anything luckily) and watched a local production of A Midsummer Night's Dream. You know what, it was pretty good. Afterwards, we returned to the school and went to OT for a few minutes, and then third period. Didn't do anything in Culinary Arts, and in theater we're slowly coming close to midterms...oh...we have to present a one minute long monologue in front of the class as the midterm, so we're slowly doing different versions before. Like today, we did a nonverbal monologue, though I didn't present. That's all.</p>
    <p>bye ig</p>
