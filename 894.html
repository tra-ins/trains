    <h4>3/26/25 &#45; 4:58 PM CDT &#45; Video Project...</h4>
    <h1>Today was fine.</h1> 
    <p>In JROTC we did our inspection and then marched. In CJ a National Guard recruiter told us about National Guard stuff. And gendered me properly. Despite seeing the uniform I was wearing and my dead name. You're never going to convince me to join with that. In Spanish, we did 2 Gimkits and it was really fun. In the 2nd one I was on the same team as my teacher and we kept going back and forth and taking the flag of the other team with barely and resistence. We won 21-1. Also we're doing a video project, and I'm doing it alone. Lovely. My verb is 'buscar'. Help. In Biology we did notes and I finished my work from yesterday. How do you talk to people??? I could never approach this pretty girl I see everyday. sob emoji.</p>
