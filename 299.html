    <h4>8/9/23 &#45; 4:52 PM CDT &#45; The Third Day</h4>
    <h1>Today also sucked.</h1>
    <p>Homeroom, my teacher asked me if I was a history buff :///, I said yes though and he was going on about how everyone will hate him (sounding like my English teacher last year). JROTC we walked around to see the Raiders obstacle course being made, and we saw a slideshow from last year of it. In Algebra, we just did a pre-assessment thing and there was a scary amount of absolute value??? I haven’t done that since 7th grade. And the teacher mispronounced my last name in the worst way possible. After was Culinary Arts, in which we did Go Fish but with forks. I didn’t match 12 forks of the same style (my most was 4 I think), but I did get 11/12 of the names from people I needed. I heard someone blast The Other Side from The Greatest Showman at one point??? In theater we discussed theater and everyone was loud and someone threw a Kleenex thing at me. That’s all.</p>
    <p>Bye.</p>
