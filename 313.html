    <h4>8/23/23 &#45; 2:55 PM CDT &#45; Chef</h4>
    <h1>today sucky suck suck but we have earlier end times for the rest of the week (today to Friday) which is polarizing</h1>
    <p>We had theater first, in which we did a quiz. I probably failed. In JROTC we started fittings early. Help. In Algebra I was finished with everything, and I forgot my laptop so I just went on TikTok. In Culinary I finally finished the math worksheet and I helped a little bit by doing manual labor, I waited for a while and I had got my phone out and tried scrolling on TikTok and nearly immediately, Chef noticed and told me to put it away and wash my hands. Anyway, after we went to lunch and then left the school.</p>
    <p>for some reason my phone was still connected to the school wifi while i was on the bus. like i was miles away from the school and i was still connected to the working wifi. um??? not complaining tho i only noticed when i was checking my phone near my stop.</p>
    <p>bye</p>
