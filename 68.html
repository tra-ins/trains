    <h4>12/21/22 &#45; 12:48 PM CST &#45; Mario Kart</h4>
    <h1>Best school day and Wednesday EVER. Well it was a half day but--</h1>
    <p>Only stayed in homeroom, so here's a recap:</p>
    <p>I texted my mom asking if I could sleep, and I almost did, but then I changed my mind and got ready for school. There were barely anyone on the bus and I was confused why some people didn't have backpacks. Upon arrival at school, I asked my friend why he was here, and sat down. On the bus from and to school, I was playing Pokemon Black 2 on my DS Lite. Yes, I brought it to school.</p>
    <p>At homeroom, I just chilled on my phone, but got my laptop and went to work finishing the main facility of my Minecraft factory. Yes, I also finished the factory near the end of the day. Minutes after, my social studies teachers puts her Switch on the projector and we started playing Mario Kart. I won both matches (destroyed the computer, art, social studies teachers, it was 100cc so it was easy) (1st on all rounds), though the 2nd one (1st, 1st, 2nd, 3rd. I got 3rd on the last track because I hate Rainbow Road and I kept falling off. The 2nd place one was a photofinish with the computer) was cut short and I retired.</p>
    <p>After Mario Kart, people who just came and my classmates started playing Just Dance 2021 and I just worked on the factory.</p>
    <p>They played Just Dance for a while, but they started doing karaoke which was cut short after All I Want for Christmas is You.</p>
    <p>Also, these events weren't short, but my writing just makes it sound short.</p>
    <p>After that, we cleaned up and I just played on my phone.</p>
    <p>Left and here I am now, man today was so fun.</p>
    <p>UPDATE: ONE LAST THING. I forgot to mention that there's this guy in my class who found a dead body near where he was fishing with his friend last night.</p>
    <p>bye!</p>
