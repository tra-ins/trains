    <h4>3/31/25 &#45; 4:47 PM CDT &#45; I Heart Biology (the class)</h4>
    <h1>Today was ok.</h1> 
    <p>In JROTC we discussed communication. In CJ we talked about tactical gear. In Spanish we began learning about the preterite tense (help) and I spent the rest of class updating my spreadsheet. And in Biology we did more boring work. I love Biology! The class. I wish I wasn't so shy that I may talk to the pretty girl in my class!!</p>
    <p>bye</p>
