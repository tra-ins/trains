    <h4>2/17/23 &#45; 6:59 PM CST &#45; Touching Grass</h4>
    <h1>Today was mediocre, but not that bad? Like it kind of sucked but also didn't kind of suck, if you know what I mean?</h1>
    <p>Assembly sucked. It was boring. As usual. Copious amounts of sentences for no apparent reason.</p>
    <p>Science lab. It was easy. I HATE EXTRUSIVE AND INTRUSIVE IGNEOUS ROCKS!!! Still easy. Got to touch obsidian, quartz, etcetera.</p>
    <p>Went to English class. Did IXL because I have no hope left for this world. Also I was stuck on W.16 in a specific grade level and I almost broke the screen of the laptop. Got a Nutty Buddy and Oatmeal Creme Pie from the teacher for free (I don't get the hype for Cosmic Brownies) and they were fine. Just fine. Don't ever feed them to me again, unless I was starving.</p>
    <p>At lunch, I almost won Uno but my friend cheated because he used his final card which was a card that makes you pick 2 from someone's deck (made up rule) and he had to choose from mine (I had exactly 2 cards left) and he made me rock paper scissors shoe (shoot) (shoe is just a mishearing of shoot that I always use) (but I don't care) AND I ACTUALLY LOST TO THAT FOOL. He still cheated. I rest my case.</p>
    <p>Math was so annoying because my classmates are DENSE. Ultra dense. Only FIVE out of the entire class (and ten before us in the previous periods) passed that VERY EASY DOMAIN & RANGE AND ORDERED PAIRS QUIZ. IT WAS SO EASY????? Forgot to mention but I timed the amount of time to finish that test, and it was 1:45:09 (1 min 45 sec 09 milisec). Also, my very white American mathematics educator said 'chewsday'. Not Tuesday, chewsday, innit.</p>
    <p>PE was traumatic, as usual, we played dodgeball (ok), but I failed to catch the ball twice and got out. I'M NOT EVEN THAT BAD!!!!!</p>
    <p>RTI was fine but still traumatic IXL!!!!!!!!!</p>
    <p>Went outside for like an hour with a tennis ball and gym clothes (t-shirt and shorts), with my dog(s). In cool weather. Whilst sick. I feel more sick, even though I almost vomited. I accidentally threw the ball in someone else's yard and looked like I was psychotic while running over there and getting the ball like a heist. Also did 10 pushups after. I can touch grass! FORGOT TO MENTION BUT I FOUND A DEAD BIRD IN THE YARD.</p>
    <p>Bye...</p>
