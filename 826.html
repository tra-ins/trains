    <h4>1/17/25 &#45; 4:44 PM CST &#45; Battleship</h4>
    <h1>Today was eh.</h1>
    <p>In JROTC we had a PT day, and there's a new uniform I need to get. Also I wore a binder. On PT day. BUT BUT BUT BUTTTT we only stretched. I just walked around outside the rest of the time. In CJ we watched a documentary about MLK Jr. In Spanish we played Battleship with our sides of the room as groups, and I wrote down most of the answers in time, but nobody called on me to answer. And I was participating!!! In Biology, we did another boring assignment.</p>
    <p>bye</p>
