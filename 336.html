    <h1>today was boring flooring yawny yawn yawn</h1>
    <p>In JROTC we did PT stuff, and my legs (especially my left leg) are in severe pain. I feel like I broke my leg (pretty sure I didn't but I should probably do something about it), lol. In Algebra, we did functions, and I turned in the test that I rushed to complete in the morning, because my mom asked me if I was missing any work or something, which reminded me that I forgot to do it. Got a 100 though, so it's okay. Speaking of the morning, I saw the annoying kid from specifically Tuesday April 18th 2023, who called out for me. Great. In Culinary, I just went on my phone (I had a C for a bit because my teacher graded one of my assignments as missing wrongly, but she fixed it by herself at some point, so yay I still have an A). And in theater, I did present my nonverbal monologue, but not my new one line monologue, involving a character named Jerry eating a burger at McDonald's and getting a call on their phone, then leaving.</p>
    <p>bye</p>
