    <h1>Today was meh.</h1>
    <p>In Criminal Justice, we did notes about probation and watched more of the OJ doc, in Geometry we watched Frozen, in English we watched The Book Thief, and in Spanish, we learned Spanish (my teacher didn't say anything to me thankfully). Stream Sugar in the Tank by Julien Baker & TORRES por favor.</p>
    <p>goodbye</p>
