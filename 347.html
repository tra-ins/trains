    <h4>9/26/23 &#45; 4:20 PM CDT &#45; Theater Sucks (ft. Grades Dropping! Ermmm woopsies!)</h4>
    <h1>today stinky as well quite indeed.</h1>
    <p>I forgot what happened in JROTC, it wasn't important. In Algebra, I got a ONE HUNED on a test. In Culinary, I just did nothing. And in theater, in theater, in theater, in theatre...monologues. That's all! Also my grade in Culinary dropped to a 94 and my theater grade dropped to an 89 yesterday. Wow. I love school!</p>
    <p>Bye</p>
