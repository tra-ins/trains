    <h4>3/31/23 &#45; 5:46 PM CDT &#45; That One Thunderstorm</h4>
    <h1>Today was okay.</h1>
    <p>No assembly because the principal wasn't there at the moment and nobody else wanted to do it!! Yay!!! Homeroom was just the usual.</p>
    <p>It started thunderstorming, especially during science, when it struck near the portables! Also, science was okay since I already did the work and just played The Oregon Trail (rip) and MC.</p>
    <p>ELA!!! I FINISHED MY POWERPOINT??? KIND OF HAVE TO REVISE CHAPTER 11 (FINAL CHAPTER) BUT WOOHOOOOO UNIT TEST NEXT WEEK!!! FREDERICK DOUGLASS'S NARRATIVE HITS HARD.</p>
    <p>Math; uhhh it was boring, didn't even grade the tests yet because EVERYONE [except me] WASN'T FINISHED. I did answer a question about dilations, something about (kx, ky) because my class is dumb!!</p>
    <p>Theater in the gym because of the choir competition, whatever, I just watched people play dodgeball while sneaking on my phone. Uhhh also I saw my crush in a dress like concert black but it actually looked good and insert the heart eyes emoji here!!! Girlboss!!!</p>
    <p>RTI!!! :))) Stan RTI! No IXL today haha I just played Minecraft haha factory world!</p>
    <p>JTA Day 25; god only knows if it can continue due to the acceptance letter</p>
