    <h4>4/29/25 &#45; 4:50 PM CDT &#45; Already Making Mistakes for Next Year (and it Hasn't Began Yet)</h4>
    <h1>Today was ok.</h1> 
    <p>Biology EOC: 54 questions, 75 minutes. Had queer computer problems. Yeah. I don't care about aerobic and anaerobic respiration and marine animals. We went to 1st period after (it was 2nd first) and I rewatched s2e7 of IWTV. In Spanish we just did some work, emailed the Dual Enrollment counselor and asked her if it was too late to do the associates degree program (it was), and was told by my Spanish teacher that I should take Spanish 3. I already transferred out. I think I'll try to switch out of ACT Prep for it. In Biology we watched more than half of Jurassic Park.</p>
    <p>bye</p>
