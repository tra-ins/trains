    <h4>2/3/23 &#45; 4:39 PM CST &#45; Peanut Oil</h4>
    <h1>Heathers is really good; but today was fine.</h1>
    <p>I just won a giveaway for a rank in a ROBLOX AGT-like group and I feel absolutely nothing but a tiny bit of joy that would've been maxmized if I was like 9-years-old or something.</p>
    <p>Science was annoying (3RD CARD WRITTEN), ELA was fine I guess (easy Amplify Grammar and I already did Quil), unit test is on Monday and the next unit starts on Tuesday, lunch was awkward and my friend was ticked off for some reason (and ykw thought I was crying even though I just mumbled "tired" to this guy who is indeed a guy I think), uhh math was weird because the teacher was talking about functions but then for like the last 10 minutes of class, he started talking about how you grind peanuts to make peanut butter and that there's peanut oil, and also said that we probably eat more carbs in a day than he does in a month, and then explained diabetes. Art was art, WROTE MY FOURTH CARD (this time to my social studies teacher. Third was to the other science teacher because she's sick or something). RTI was RTI.</p>
    <p>Today was annoying and I wished we just skipped school altogether, but whatever. I HATE FRIDAYS.</p>
    <p>Bye.</p>
