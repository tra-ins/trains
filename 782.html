    <h4>12/4/24 &#45; 4:35 PM CST &#45; EOCs Once More</h4>
    <h1>Took English EOC subpart 2 today. Today was meh.</h1>
    <p>22 questions, and I struggled at the grammar part. And a few other questions. So that was nice. After we did nothing, and I finished rewatching IWTV in English and read MtD, and did Spanish work.</p>
    <p>Goodbye</p>
