    <h4>5/2/24 &#45; 5:00 PM CDT &#45; Son</h4>
    <h1>Today was okay.</h1>
    <p>I was at the bus stop and some old person excused themself and called me son. Yippee though someone at my bus stop said something like, "someone just called her a boy" about me so ermmm ignoring that! AP World did more notes. English worked on project. Science did work. JROTC exercised, and finally I have done the first sit ups of my life. I do not know how, probably the binder. I exercised with a binder on. Which includes a 1 mile run. Got a 13:42! Ruined a binder though.</p>
    <p>Bye</p>
