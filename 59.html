    <h4>12/12/22 &#45; 6:27 PM CST &#45; Open Borders</h4>
    <h1>Today was pretty good, if I'd say so.</h1>
    <p>I didn't have any missing work so I just played Tetris in social studies, ELA was easy, math was honestly not very hard today, art was fine, and RTI was RTI.</p> <p>I think the only reason why I can't really remember anything from today is because I'm now stuck writing a whole essay sort of thing about the positives of open border policy because I ranted about foreign policy in general, which included open borders, after my friend mentioned Ukraine. HELP I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE!!!!!!!!!!</p>
    <p>YK who thinks I cheated in Uno after I won against him. No I didn't, sore loser. Also he made a huge deal about me texting him at exactly 12 in the morning as a joke because he called and texted me at 10:30 PM on a Friday night right before I was about to go to sleep.</p>
    <p>BYE.</p>
