    <h1>I love Thursdays sort of.</h1>
    <p>Social studies was fine, ELA was fine. OH MY GOD I WAS RIGHT ELIZABETH DOES DIE AND VICTOR'S DAD NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO I HATE VICTOR!!! Also my teacher got mad and started yelling at us and that she was from the hood of Florida and a big city, not our small town.</p>
    <p>Math easy. Art okay, she just ranted about how we should stop being childish.</p>
    <p>RTI weird as usual, oh how the traumatizing stories people tell in that class.</p>
    <p>BYE,</p>
