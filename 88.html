    <h4>1/10/23 &#45; 5:30 PM CST &#45; No Kickball</h4>
    <h1>Today was okay, until 8th period (EXTRA PE GAHHHHHH).</h1>
    <p>Homeroom I brought my Switch again and played Tetris (help) (my teacher told us to put our phones up and then looked at me and said something along the lines of, "and your Switch". She thought I was playing Fortnite, judging by the screen where I was clearly playing Puyo Puyo Tetris on.), science was boring, but in ELA we did the RTI math test thing again and I don't know if I failed or not, but I don't think I failed? In the middle of it, she POINTED AT ME AGAIN and she finally remembered that she said that whoever got the highest score or whatever on that one test thing would get something. I never forgot. I think it was the Reading Benchmark from December 8th? IDK, but I was in the middle of going over the 45 questions over and over again until I felt like it was safe to submit, when I overheard her talking to someone that I "beat" them (SHE SAID MY NAME). ??????</p>
    <p>Anyway, math was math (teacher asked all of us what we were gonna do when we're older, I said "idk", and he said, "COLLEGE PROFESSOR". I was like, "nononononoono"), but PE. PE. REMEMBER THE COACH GUY? HE FAILED HIS PROMISE. HE SAID WE WOULD DO KICKBALL. AND WE DIDN'T. NOT EVEN AFTER 7TH PERIOD. At least in 7th period I only stared at the fence for like 10-20 minutes, because I ended up talking to my friend and his friend who's in the magnet school thing. But he left in 8th period to do his other thing, theater? RTI? I forgot, I think theater. 8th period was so boring and I was fed up with it. Anyway, I think I forgot to ask the PE teacher if I could stay with the art teacher during PE or something. WAIT HELP??? ALSO I THINK THE COACH WAS PROBABLY THINKING THE PE TEACHER WITH THE SAME NAME AS THE ART TEACHER WHEN I ASKED HIM ABOUT IT AGAIN??? HELPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP</p>
    <p>Bringing my Switch again tomorrow to play during RTI. I think I should work on the other areas near my MC factory, but I just can't resist Tetris.</p>
    <p>Yeah, bye.</p>
