    <h4>11/4/22 &#45; 6:33 PM CDT &#45; Kango</h4>
    <h1>Weird Friday?</h1>
    <p>ASSEMBLY I HATE CHRISTMAS MUSIC STOP PLAYING IT OUTSIDE OF DECEMBER!! Easy A on a science test, didn't hear anything about the A honor roll pictures, so might've missed that. Oops! But ELA is where we REALLY get started.</p>
    <p>Quill, easy as always. Every other Friday is a day where you get to spend your bucks on candy, but I didn't spend any, and I didn't even claim the reward for doing all of the Quill lessons. My teacher was worried because I just said "no" (grrr I wasn't polite that's so irregular) (WHAT EVEN IS REGULAR AT THIS POINT??) and I was like "yeah I'm fine" (I always say either fine or good) and the confrontation was what made me cry at lunch</p>
    <p>So at lunch, I just ate my food (I pack, filthy peasants) and started crying even more uncontrollably (like I didn't want to cry at that moment and I tried sleeping, but SOMEONE ALWAYS WAKES ME UP), and I was like "yo I'm fine!" because I didn't know what else to say, but I ended up chilling with one of my favorite teachers (sorta teacher) for the rest in the hallway. And the art teacher came and I LOVE HER SO MUCH BLESS HER, and she said my art was really good (or something along the lines of that), I was starting to cry again because I was surprised, I'm literally a terrible artist but go off queen??? Also she said I could get my phone and play games on it (even though my English teacher gets ANGRY if you don't put your phone in the pouch, but whatever!!!). Also my English teacher was asking if I was okay after lunch and she said I didn't "look" okay (or whatever, it was something like okay). I didn't go in-depth about what I'd been feeling for the past few weeks when I talked about it, though. I could write a paragraph of valid reasons.</p>
    <p>Math boring, art kind of boring but the teacher always goated, and RTI was RTI.</p>
    <p>A kango is slang for a jackhammer. Or at least that's what I think it is, because my English teacher listened to this rap (?) song one of my classmates was listening to and gave actual criticism about the song itself, and was confused on what a kango was.</p>
    <p>ok bye</p>
