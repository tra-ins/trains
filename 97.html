    <h4>1/19/23 &#45; 7:48 PM CST &#45; Didn't Go</h4>
    <h1>Didn't go to school today.</h1>
    <p>Thursdays are supposed to be good, right? Right?? I love social studies: history, geography, government stuff, the silly p word that ends with cs, law???, I HATE ECONOMICS THOUGH IF YOU LIKE ECONOMICS LEAVE THIS INSTANT, etc. I love A days. I love learning more about the political turmoil of early US history. But. I can't. I couldn't.</p>
    <p>I was so tired and so annoyed, and so peeved with school that I begged my mom not to go.</p>
    <p>I guess I haven't really been feeling myself lately; myself--who am I really, anyway?</p>
    <p>I just. Don't want to go back there. I hate school. I hate life itself.</p>
    <p>shoutouts to my friends who made me play OMORI and now I've been traumatized and utterly obsessed (esp w/ Basil;v;v;v;;;;;;;.,,,,, & that one silly ship--). tysm for making me rethink my entire life, just like the good ol' bw 2020 days!</p>
    <p>Stayed in bed the entire time.</p>
    <p>HELP PLEASE</p>
    <p>bye</p>
