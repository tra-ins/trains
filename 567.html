    <h4>5/3/24 &#45; 4:39 PM CDT &#45; My Watch is Not Dead</h4>
    <h1>Today was mediocre.</h1>
    <p>AP World did notes. English finished project without the artistically inclined group member. Science did assignment. JROTC played kickball. My watch that I have owned for 2 years died and I thought it was dead forever, but it is alive. Its battery is just bad now. Huzzah! My watch will not die!</p>
    <p>Bye</p>
