    <h4>2/28/23 &#45; 10:54 PM CST &#45; Kevin</h4>
    <h1>Today was something.</h1>
    <p>Woke up early, got ready and was dropped off at my sister’s dorm (where we ate Dunkin’ and food from campus), got picked up by parents where I watched them eat at a kabob place, witnessed personal stuff go down in a parking lot (at least I got a free Roblox giftcard from my dad), went to the airport early, no Sprite at that airport so I had to try Crush (mid), ate at a Chinese place (potstickers and egg rolls mmm yum), spilled soy sauce all over myself and my backpack, waited more, boarded the plane, watched High School Musical (banger), got off and took a Lyft with my mom home from this nice country guy named Kevin (he was literally playing country music and had the look and accent), my mom talked to him a bit (whilst I listed to ‘My Dead Gay Son’ from Heathers ;)) (he’s like a football coach of a private school or something) got home, and here I am now, typing this first draft on my phone.</p>
    <p>Bye</p>
