    <h4>11/24/22 &#45; 0:00 AM CST &#45; Giving Thanks</h4>
    <h1>The 24th was Thanksgiving, and we just watched the parade and dog show, ate food, slept early at like 8:30 PM, felt super sick, woke up at 1 AM or 12 AM feeling like I had the flu, almost threw up, called my mom, changed my mind, watched YouTube Shorts until 3 in the morning, which is when I fell asleep and woke up many times.</h1>
    <p>It was okay.</p>
