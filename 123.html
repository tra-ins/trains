    <h1>Today sucks.</h1>
    <p>Homeroom- YKW was talking about me when I USED to hit my friend with the lunch box. SOCIAL STUDIES TEACHER I DO NOT DO IT ANYMORE IT'S BEEN A MONTH OR 2???</p>
    <p>ELA was cool.</p>
    <p>Assigned seats at lunch but I accidentally sat at 12 instead of 15...with some annoying kids who were fine and called me nice because I made room for them to talk (and I threw this guy's burger away; it was VERY dry).</p>
    <p>Easy math test (ft. angles AFTER. I HATE ANGLES!!!).</p>
    <p>PE was traumatic. Tried skipping. PE teacher told me not to go if I was gonna skip. I only stayed for 5 minutes. Tried asking someone if I could join them; they IGNORED me: went back to the bathroom and tried to wipe my VERY RED TEARY eyes. Went back and was told to play with some girls; ignored them and stared at the ground for 20+ more minutes.</p>
    <p>No extra PE but I did get like one of those heartogram candygram whatevergram things from...one of the Beta advisors. I HATE BETA!!! I KNOW I HAVE A FIANCE BUT IT WOULD'VE BEEN FUNNY IF IT WAS JUST SOME ANONYMOUS PERSON :(((</p>
    <p>I DON'T WANT TO APPLY FOR THE MAGNET SCHOOL STOPPPP</p>
    <p>bye</p>
