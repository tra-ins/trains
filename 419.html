    <h4>12/7/23 &#45; 4:41 PM CST &#45; Grape Salad</h4>
    <h1>today eh</h1>
    <p>In JROTC, we barely did anything. In Algebra, we did nothing, In Culinary, we made grape salad (and I added one of my table members on a certain app...not Snap...) (it was BEAUTIFUL). And in theater, I continued working on my play. And I celebrated my step-dad's birthday.</p>
    <p>Bye</p>
