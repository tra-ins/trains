    <h4>5/16/23 &#45; 4:45 PM CDT &#45; Crack</h4>
    <h1>Today was also okay.</h1>
    <p>During science, we got our graduation stuff. Yay gowns and stuff.</p>
    <p>At ELA, we finished the Holocaust worksheet and watched a little of a video about kids in our state doing a paper clip project (Holocaust) (bc paper clips were a symbol used by Norway or something). Also, the teacher kept telling us stories of her mother-in-law and how she's a drug addict on crack, after the teacher got off a phone call that everyone was listening and laughing at.</p>
    <p>In math, we got soda and pepperoni (I DON'T EAT PEPPERONI) pizza from Little Caesar's (disgusting). And then he tried to get us to do a project about what we think the world will look like in 40 years. I don't know.</p>
    <p>Uhh theater more Newsies.</p>
    <p>At extra PE, we went on the football field, and OUT OF NOWHERE it starts raining REALLY hard, everyone started screaming and running into the bathroom door (as it's closer to the building than the main door), and this kid tried leaning on me but then SLIPPED and FELL and everyone started laughing. We then stayed in the gym for the rest of PE. Yay.</p>
    <p>Bye</p>
