    <h4>4/25/23 &#45; 5:01 PM CDT &#45; TCAP Day 6 - "Airpods"</h4>
    <h1>TCAP Part 6--Math done! Today was mid.</h1>
    <p>During TCAP math subpart 2 out of 3, I dropped my pencil and struggled to pick it up, so I shrugged and left it be, until my teacher just comes over and gives me a new pencil. Lol.</p>
    <p>The TCAPs were much longer than the previous, especially because the other classes took super long, so we came to ELA right before lunch.</p>
    <p>At ELA, we didn't really do anything since we had no time, so we just talked. The teacher asked us who's definitely not going to the reward trip, I raised my hand, and she mentioned it, saying how I "didn't like x" or something, and I told her I was going to a graduation on that day.</p>
    <p>After was math, which the teacher made us do that house puzzle again. It's literally impossible. I only tried more because I want money. Also, while we were at the bathrooms, one of my classmates was asking who was making some sort of noise, and asked if I was using airpods or something. I showed my hands from my pockets and was asked or told something by that person and my ex-crush, but I can't really remember because I reacted by checking my watch and completely ignoring it.</p>
    <p>In theater, the teacher made us watch 38 minutes and 5 seconds of Shrek the Musical. Yummy.</p>
    <p>Extra PE was the usual extra PE things.</p>
    <p>ok bye.</p>
