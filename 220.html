    <h1>Today was weird.</h1>
    <p>Uhh Dunkin, practiced graduation stuff for a couple hours, watched Mario movie in homeroom, didn't go to ELA.</p>
    <p>Oh God, math. Classmates were bothering me, annoying whatever. Mentioned when I saw them at Walmart that one time on Black Friday (?), kept passing "notes" asking to be my "friend". I kept saying random letters and words to be annoying back. But I got their numbers just to spam Game Pigeon.</p>
    <p>Uhh theater they put on West Side Story but I wasn't interested, so I just went on my phone.</p>
    <p>RTI, ermmmm said "kys" after losing to classmate in 8 ball and the teacher asked me how I felt about it. Wow. At least my social studies award was laminated.</p>
    <p>Haircut...ummm...yep.</p>
    <p>bye</p>
