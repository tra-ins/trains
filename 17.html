    <h1>Halloween, I guess. Also old Halloween event go brrr...ew Mondays!</h1>
    <p>Unova Villain Arc! Slayed. N--</p>
    <p>I forgot my lunch today (this will have much significance later).</p>
    <p>Well, I do not know where to begin. Today was weird. Very weird.</p>
    <p>For starters, we didn't do anything in social studies. I guess it was an independent work day, but I literally never have much unfinished work to do, so I just chilled and GRINDED Tetris. I was FOCUSED FOCUSED on Tetris, y'all can't even IMAGINE it. Next was English, which was weird...? We just did a book cover thing (literally just drew the house of The Landlady, I forgot the other floors though but SHH), and a worksheet. Help I hate logic puzzles I keep forgetting how to do them, STOP!!!!</p>
    <p>Lunch was weird. I was going to go to the honor roll party, but I decided not to [during period 1, because I made lots of realizations, though it was during period 3/4 which is MAAATH] and just try to survive during math class. You know what. I don't care, but I did try to sleep during lunch, but was woken up by one of my favorite teachers! Also the free lunch was nasty and I threw away the other half of the SANDWICH thing??? I really wish I remembered my lunch, do I! (My first actual post will be a list of reasons why I didn't go to the party with the other honor roll kids)</p>
    <p>After math and lunch, was art. It was fine. I like my teacher. She approached me and pointed at the pineapple pizza festival I was drawing and said VERBATIM MIGHT I ADD, "Pineapple pizza is amazing", with me replying, "facts", and she went on to add how people shouldn't even debate pizza [caused people at my table to reply and agree with her]. I love her.</p>
    <p>PE was torment as usual, teachers forcing us to dance. Cotton Eyed Joe. HELP I ACTUALLY WANTED TO DO THE PACER AT THAT POINT!!!</p>
    <p>Halloween is pretty cool I guess. Los Pollos Hermanos employee! Woohoo! Bye!</p>
