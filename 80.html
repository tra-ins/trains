    <h4>1/2/23 &#45; 10:50 PM CST &#45; Marshmallows</h4>
    <h1>Not much has happened lately. It's a Monday, and most of my friends have Winter Break ending tomorrow or Wednesday, so I'll be even more bored! Yay! Winter Break ends on the 9th (exactly a week from now) for me, so.</h1>
    <p>I made my mom get me a pack of Lucky Charms' marshmallows and I regret everything, because it wasn't like the actual packs of Lucky Charms' marshmallows. No. It was just regular dehydrated marshmallows. HELPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP!!!!!!! I think I'm going to get various food-related diseases from consuming this much sugar, not pointing out the obvious disease that matches with this description.</p>
