    <h4>5/3/23 &#45; 5:08 PM CDT &#45; Red Shoes</h4>
    <h1>Today was okay.</h1>
    <p>Another social studies webquest, whatever, but also in class, my teacher was super mad at us because of the whole Snapchat thing. The full story now that I know is that someone made accounts of most of the teachers in my grade on Snapchat and added random people (and a few even talked to the people they added). I think they were made yesterday, since that's when I saw 2 of the accounts during science class. It's a whole mystery, I heard that someone got snitched on, but I'm not sure, and there's even a 40 dollar bounty. Also in science, I just worked on my paper.</p>
    <p>In ELA, we did the math EasyCBM and it was pretty easy. But before that, my English teacher was VERY mad, yelling and they even said the s word. They were saying how they don't wear red shoes, and the person who made their profile gave them red shoes, and how the person who made my social studies teacher's profile did them dirty, and also how the other math teacher that I don't have has blonde hair and not whatever color they did (brown or white IDK). It was so funny, I was crying of laughter and when the teacher was passing us mints during the RTI test, she asked me if I did it, since I was laughing a lot. I didn't do it, it was just really funny!!!</p>
    <p>In math, we continued the riddles and the girls are still winning, yay.</p>
    <p>Theater, watched Mean Girls.</p>
    <p>Uhhh RTI worked on paper.</p>
    <p>Bye.</p>
