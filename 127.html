    <h4>2/18/23 &#45; 9:50 PM CST &#45; Wedding (ft. Basil and Dead Bird Grave)</h4>
    <h1>Ahh, February 18th, Basil's birthday. OMORI is so cool, I wish friends were real. Happy birthday, character in which I have acquired much adoration for. Also best character don't @ me, I think all of the characters in RW are good but Basil just takes the cake to me.</h1>
    <p>Touched grass again for a hour. Dug a grave with a shovel for the bird and also destroyed the environment by putting it in a plastic Walmart bag. I live in a Republican state so I think we've done worse--Did 10 pushups after like a GIRLBOSS.</p>
    <p>Had my wedding today with my wife Sharon and my friend who acted as the pastor and flower boy. We then started a family on Roblox. And real life. This is not a ruse.</p>
    <p>Bye???</p>
