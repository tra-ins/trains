    <h4>2/26/23 &#45; 9:01 PM EST &#45; Mall Excursion</h4>
    <h1>Today was awesome.</h1>
    <p>Got hair cut (too short and now I look like an emo Karen), got Dunkin, picked up my sister from college, was late to the excursion, was awkward but went to Dave n’ Busters, immense silliness ensued (ft. me throwing and losing 2 of the cup ping balls, etc), wandered around the mall more, said our farewells a few hours later, got lost all the way to JC Penny, said bye to the old house, got McDonald’s, and came back to our room. Very fun.</p>
    <p>Bye</p>
