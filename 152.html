    <h4>3/15/23 &#45; 5:20 PM CDT &#45; Peacoat & Paranoia</h4>
    <h1>Today was bad.</h1>
    <p>Ok uhh social studies easy Trail of Tears map, heard people fail basic US state geography, and no, I don't think I'd be capable of randomly using sign language I can't even remember my Duolingo Dutch lessons, classmate.</p>
    <p>Science was whatever, I guess.</p>
    <p>ELA the usual uhh umm...</p>
    <p>My so called "friend" whom I despise kept bothering me and calling my name and tapping my shoulder, like bruh if someone is blatantly ignoring you, they obviously don't want to talk to you. I have to admit, I did use the lunchbox twice unfortunately. At least I didn't completely snap and strangle him.</p>
    <p>Uhh after lunch we went to the bathrooms, ELA teacher was like, "someone went to the store" and complemented my red and white patterned peacoat. Thanks, I guess, but I heard people (ykw girl included) (WITH MY CRUSH) talking about my altercation with my so called "friend". I'm doomed. There shall be no rizz.</p>
    <p>Math, whatever, at one point everyone said my name about something with some kid who's in our class for some reason now. I think it was about matchmaking or something. SHUT UP SHUT UP SHUT UP!!!! I'M NOT INTO ANY OF THE RUDE & (no offense) UGLY GUYS (they wear Nike techs) AT THIS DUMB SCHOOL!!!! At least a classmate complimented my coat, smh.</p>
    <p>Uhhh I just played MC during PE because of the STEAM fair. My math class went to the STEAM fair and I just wandered around until it was time for PE.</p>
    <p>RTI was fine. The usual IXL stuff, I don't know.</p>
    <p>Absolutely no rizz. I have to reiterate this lots of times that I indeed have no rizz. And now I'm paranoid like 7th grade about what people say about me!!! Yay!!! Can't wait for tomorrow.</p>
    <p>JTA Day 9.</p>
    <p>Bye.</p>
