    <h4>8/24/23 &#45; 2:54 PM CDT &#45; Oil Bug</h4>
    <h1>today sucky suck suck suck</h1>
    <p>Uhh theater group thing, in JROTC we did more fitting and I only got my shirt done. I was kind of late to Algebra but it was okay because one of the instructors gave me a note and another walked me down. Algebra I just snook on my phone as we did review for the unit.</p>
    <p>In Culinary Arts, we did more manual labor for two hours. I scrubbed, rinsed, cleaned some shelves and fridges, and I even found two dead bugs! One of them was in a huge thing of oil.</p>
    <p>My Basil (OMORI) plush came today!!!! He's so awesomesauce. Also reminder that today is Day 24 of watching Heathers daily.</p>
    <p>bye</p>
