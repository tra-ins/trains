    <h4>4/22/24 &#45; 4:54 PM CDT &#45; I Hate C Lunch</h4>
    <h1>Today was mid.</h1>
    <p>AP World graded teacher's DBQ. English read chapter 7 (I already read chapter 7 on Friday because the teacher said to but okay...also Johnny dies in chapter 9 not chapter 8 my memory was wrong). Science learned more about atoms, and we had C lunch today and we have it until Wednesday. Great. JROTC we talked about cybersecurity.</p>
    <p>bye</p>
