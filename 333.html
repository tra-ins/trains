    <h1>today was also boring and thoroughly uneventful (tho i heard ppl right next to me talking abt me during theater lol)</h1>
    <p>In JROTC we finished watching this one video or something. In Algebra, we did algebra. In Culinary, we did another worksheet. And in theater, we did some more things with like articulators or whatever. Later I might go to this meeting for some international adventures thing, which might also be a PTO meeting??? idk lol i dont trust my mom</p>
