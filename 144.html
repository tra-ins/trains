    <h4>3/7/23 &#45; 7:24 PM CST &#45; JROTC Training Arc</h4>
    <h1>Today was awful.</h1>
    <p>Social studies- fine, the usual, epic.</p>
    <p>ELA- benchmark. Did some of Chapter 6 PowerPoint slide after.</p>
    <p>At lunch, I tried sleeping and everyone bothered me at one point.</p>
    <p>After lunch, I banged on my laptop as usual but just a little louder [was a bit stressed and mad] and everyone stared at me, and the teacher said, "[my name]...that's what crazy people do" and I tried smiling it off [didn't say anything just smiled] and almost cried. Also, my crush sits in front of me and she saw and heard what happened. RIP.</p>
    <p>Math- Pythagorean theorem test, easy. I finished it in like 4 minutes 53 seconds or around that which was a bit too slow for my taste but not as bad. The teacher was very mad at us.</p>
    <p>Period 7 PE, bad as always, slayed the pacer 5 back and forths and got first. Uhh also saw some cute IA or whatever girl idk who she is but she had a cute cream shirt and brown vest and pants and I was in awe.</p>
    <p>JROTC Training Arc...exercise!!! Day 3.</p>
