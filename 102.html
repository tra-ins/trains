    <h4>1/24/23 &#45; 5:00 PM CST &#45; Cop</h4>
    <h1>Uhhh today was weird.</h1>
    <p>Science lab (not bad, partners weren't terrible), ELA we acted out the scenes with Mercutio, Benvolio, etc before and after the Fight Scene; we're going to do the scenes after where Juliet stabs herself (?????), etc soon I think. Got to hold a sword and sort of fight as my teacher's example and I was chosen by sticks as the cop/first citizen/citizen/whatever. Totally slayed, might/going to be Friar Lawrence or whatever next time (teacher told me I should because I'm so slay) (I wanted to be Juliet so I could experience what it's like to stab myself with a toy dagger but whatever :((().</p>
    <p>Uhhh math was whatever, went to PE instead of Art, broke down in tears, was taken to the counselor, talked for an hour, played Uno for 15 minutes, and overall didn't learn anything and still resent gym, PE/extra PE, waking up at 6:30 AM, etc.</p>
    <p>Romeo is a murderer and I too indeed hate him :D</p>
    <p>obey.</p>
    <p>Friend might be mad because I kept hitting the button that makes noise on the Uno Triple Play thing during lunch.</p>
    <p>bye.</p>
