    <h4>5/15/25 &#45; 5:20 PM CDT &#45; Strawberry DNA</h4>
    <h1>Today was fine.</h1> 
    <p>In JROTC I played Pokemon the entire period. In CJ we did notes. In Spanish I got mad a bit and did poorly on an assignment about the imperfect tense. And in Biology, we did the strawberry DNA lab and it was pretty fun, I got to sit across that really pretty girl in my class but we never talked to each other :( also the seniors graduate today good for them</p>
    <p>bye</p>
