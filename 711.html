    <h4>9/24/24 &#45; 4:59 PM CDT &#45; Who Are You?</h4>
    <h1>Criminal Justice we answered questions since the teacher was gone. Geometry we learned AAS and ASA. English we read more of Night. Spanish we started Chapter 3. I was talking to my friend and she asked me "Who are you?" I don't think anyone can really answer that, lol. She might be reading this, if she found this website somehow. Hi M.</h1>
    <p>forgot to mention but i woke up at 3 am and i was really thirsty but my breath stank so i had some mouthwash. but i was still rlly thirsty so i gave in and drank water. and i was still thirsty. so i drank soda that my parents had got for the visitors from sunday and i was stil thirsty. and i felt sick. so i scrolled on my phone, watching clips of julien baker's first concert for her current tour until i had to get dressed for school at like 6:30. i was so scared i was just under my blankets hearing it thunder and stuff lol.</p>
    <p>Bye</p>
