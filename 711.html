    <h1>Criminal Justice we answered questions since the teacher was gone. Geometry we learned AAS and ASA. English we read more of Night. Spanish we started Chapter 3. I was talking to my friend and she asked me "Who are you?" I don't think anyone can really answer that, lol. She might be reading this, if she found this website somehow. Hi M.</h1>
