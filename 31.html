    <h4>11/14/22 &#45; 5:09 PM CST &#45; Pizza</h4>
    <h1>A Monday, need I say less?</h1>
    <p>Everyone kept interrupting my social studies teacher, ELA was Prometheus or something, math we got pizza because we were good for the Veterans' Day assembly, art was okay, PE was chaotic as always.</p>
    <p>I don't have really anything to note. I liked UnoVA though. 3/5 SS N.</p>
    <p>Bye</p>
