    <h4>4/18/23 &#45; 4:48 PM CDT &#45; TCAP Day 2 - Schadenfraude/Ex-Crush</h4>
    <h1>TCAP ELA part 2! Also today was absolute garbage.</h1>
    <p>TCAPS- 11 multiple choice questions. A few were hard but the rest were pretty easy. 11 questions in 50 minutes, lol.</p>
    <p>Went to ELA, whatever, Space Race collection + Harriet movie.</p>
    <p>After ELA and lunch, we went to math and did math. Easy math.</p>
    <p>We went to science after math for the rest of school, except for the last 20 or 15 or so minutes. All was good, sneaked on my phone while watching some actually very interesting Charles Darwin documentary, however, it all would change. Some annoying kid started bothering me about having my phone out even though everyone else had theirs out (including the kid). After like 10-20 minutes of that, everyone started gaslighting the science teacher into thinking I was flashing my phone (I wasn't; just on Snap and stuff). Uhh my mom sent a picture of an email from a h school person about BEING IN ADVANCED ALGEBRA INSTEAD OF REGULAR ALGEBRA. STOP MATH TEACHER. Back to the interesting part of the story, the teacher stopped the documentary and just told us to be quiet and go on our phones, and that kid sat next to me. He then started to stare at my phone, I told him to stop and then moved away, which then he started moving towards me (science teacher said he could???). Then everyone started laughing and SHIPPING us (and saying how someone had a crush on the other out of the 2 of us), and the teacher told the kid to leave me alone. AND THEN. AND THEN. MY EX-CRUSH WAVED TOWARDS ME AND POINTED TOWARDS THE KID AND MADE A HEART. I couldn't take it anymore. I started crying out of pure anger and asked the teacher if I could step out for a moment. I sat outside and stared forwards, listening to everyone laughing and blaming people for making me cry. They kept talking about it until we got to homeroom, when I guess my social studies teacher was mad at someone because she kept telling them to stop talking about it, shut up, and sit down. My EX-crush really said "I didn't know she'd cry" or sm, LIKE GIRL ARE YOU THAT DENSE?? Anyway, I want to commit murder and now I hate my EX-crush. No more crushes woohoo!!!! TL;DR: Schadenfraude.</p>
    <p>UPDATE 4/19: I was wrong abt the above; she was mad at them because of the whole thing w/ me </p>
    <p>JTA Day 42; MY MATH TEACHER TOLD ME TO SIGN THE ACCEPTANCE LETTER!! NO!!!</p>
    <p>bye</p>
