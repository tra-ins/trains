    <h4>10/27/25 &#45; 10:51 PM CDT &#45; The Not So Mysterious Daily Update Website Journal Diary Thing I Can't Believe I Pasted This Like 5 Times, Plus The Captalization Is Completely Incorrect But I Don't Feel Like Changing It</h4>
    <h1>Having another person perceive this website is horrifying, but it's real and it's happening as we speak.</h1>
    <p>Thinking about the "why" of this website. Why did I make this? Why have I subjected myself to this? I really can't answer. I guess it's because it's been the most consistent thing in my life. Every day an update. Every once in a while, I forget or don't feel like updating, but I still update. This routine and the website itself have stayed the same for all of these three years. I think I've changed, but I probably haven't. Although nowadays reading the sentence,</p>
    <p>"NNN, I guess. I'm not a guy, but if I was, I still wouldn't care about the "challenge". I already immediately failed No Simp September, lol. N" (Update 18)</p>
    <p>amuses me, knowing vital pieces of information that I did not on November 1st, 2022. So in that sense I suppose I have changed. But let's discuss a brief history of this website.</p>
    <p>It was the 8th grade, a few months after I'd moved states. In the first quarter, I was in a mandatory computer class. In that class we did a course on the website code.org, in which we learned the basics of HTML and CSS. I was intensely fixated on this. I made a website I thought was extremely funny (it wasn't) about how to cook a pizza with pineapple on top.
    <a href="https://tra-ins.github.io/pineapple-pizza/?">Riveting.</a> I remember showing it to my teacher and I think she thought it was funny. Or she was confused. Probably the latter. But anyway, I had a lot of fun creating that website, so I created two other websites. <a href="https://tra-ins.github.io/sir-garnet/">A website about old slang I was fixated on</a> and <a href="https://tra-ins.github.io/pretty-gothic-moths/">a website in which I had asked a random person on ... Discord for an idea and went with it.</a> And then I made this website.</p>
	<p>This is all to say that I don't really remember exactly why I made this website. Perhaps I got the idea from a website or a video and that combined with my brief coding fixation led to this. I can't be sure about any of these details.</p>
	<p>Trying to find information I browse messages from my old friend group's Discord server (that was really my server, because I was all full of myself). I find that I sent the server a link to this website. Multiple times. Every time I updated I sent a link. And when I found this I decided to delete every single instance of this website from the server. Nobody has talked there in two years, but there's still people in there, so I felt I had to. In these messages I see that there once was a comments section, but I deleted it after a friend posted my legal name. Fantastic.</p>
	<p>Considering all of this, I suppose that there once was an audience for this website. Maybe an audience that I pretended existed from my friend group. But still, an audience. Maybe I wanted to be a cool blogger. I recall intending to write actual blogposts, but I never got to doing so. I'm not sure why I never did. Perhaps I just forgot. It's little aspects of my life like this website that prove that time eludes me.</p>
	<p>There's probably an update or two where I'm practically screaming through the screen about something unimportant that happened at school that annoyed me. Maybe three. Probably a lot more, actually. And now someone is perceiving this all.</p>
