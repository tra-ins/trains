    <h1>Today was mediocre</h1>
    <p>Science- already did the test from last week, did vocab and practice test thing, easy.</p>
    <p>ELA was fine because the teacher ranted for half an hour about how much she likes us but wants us to stop making terrible mistakes, etc, etc...and Frederick Douglass is still cool I guess.</p>
    <p>Also at lunch people think I'm lesbian (I am not) now because I made a joke about my wife!!!! I keep screwing things up!!! No hate if you are but I'm just proving a point. Also uhh umm I'm still debating with myself about what I am now!!!</p>
    <p>Uhh math was math.</p>
    <p>PE was traumatic as usual, scared someone in the bathroom though. That's really it.</p>
    <p>Uhh RTI was RTI, just went on my phone and also played Minecraft. More progress to the factory MC plantation.</p>
    <p>Wore the blue fancy patterned vest. Like the white one but blue instead. No compliments. I was going to wear a sweater but it was HOT when I woke up and checked the weather, so...it still is hot...I'm shirtless while typing this...and still dying...</p>
    <p>Exercised for 30 minutes after in the backyard, sort of worked out IDK. Girlboss.</p>
    <p>Bye...</p>
