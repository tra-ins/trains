    <h4>8/28/24 &#45; 4:37 PM CDT &#45; Will I Finally Quit TGAA? Let's Figure that Out!</h4>
    <h1>Today was meh.</h1>
    <p>I cried in my mom's car because she was mad at me and I kept thinking and thinking...I also read more of The Scorpion and TGSWIIWAGAA today. Anyway, Criminal Justice got a 100 on a test and they showed us batons. Geometry we did more review about slope. Slope. English we did a quick write that certainly was not a quick write, and we learned about Patrick Henry and discussed the American Revolution. Spanish we're learning how to formulate basic sentences.</p>
    <p>yep bye</p>
