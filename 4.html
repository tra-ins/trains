    <h1>I hate Tuesdays!!!</h1>
    <p>In art for this quarter, we did some weird figure thing and my teacher really told us not to ever draw stick figures, they really sounded like my Kindergarten teacher :((((</p>
    <p>BUT OH MY GOD FRANKENSTEIN KINDA GETTING GOOD THO??? LIKE I LOVE THE CREATURE HE'S SO WHOLESOME!!!!</p>
    <p>Wholesome? I'm kidding, but the dialogue between him and William was so funny honestly...</p>
    <p>You know what? Today got better in the end, even with my phone's cellular data and stuff not working still.</p>
    <p>Let's see how tomorrow goes, though I hate Wednesdays as well...</p>
