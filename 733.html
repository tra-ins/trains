    <h1>I woke up at 3 am randomly again. Today was fine.</h1>
    <p>Criminal Justice we talked about hunting, firearm and bow safety and all that. Geometry we learned about similarity transformations or whatever they're called. English we did another text and now we're working on the other essay I may or may not have neglected to talk about. Great. In Spanish we did Spanish.</p>
    <p>bye...also the new Pokemon leaks are so awesome!!! I'm loving N again I fear...</p>
