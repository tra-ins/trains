    <h4>5/10/23 &#45; 4:51 PM CDT &#45; Diss Tracks and Edibles</h4>
    <h1>Today was okay.</h1>
    <p>In homeroom, I heard that people made diss tracks of other people, and this person in Hasville did too. What.</p>
    <p>Also, we never switched to 2nd period science because the science teacher wanted to keep his homeroom, so yay!</p>
    <p>After social studies and...also social studies, we went to ELA, where we started the Holocaust unit. My teacher said that labor unions are Nazi and described socialism exactly like Nazism & fascism, and then called Nazis socialist...THEY ARE NOT SOCIALIST, THEY'RE FASCIST, WHICH IS KINDA LIKE CORPORATISM IIRC...also, my classmate said, and I quote, "I thought Jewish people were bad". KMSKMSKMS</p>
    <p>At lunch, there was a fight. In the middle of the cafeteria. I had my head down before, and when I heard yelling, I looked up and saw 2 guys tackling each other, with the helper sorta IDK he has his own classroom guy and the PE lady pulling them apart. And apparently there was a fake fight there too?</p>
    <p>In math, I heard that a couple people got suspended for having...EDIBLES at school??? SOMETHING LIKE THAT??? I SWEAR THEY SAID EDIBLES. WHAT??? When we did our bathroom break, I went with the girls, and we were confused if we were supposed to go to the upstairs bathroom or the downstairs one, so we went upstairs. However, there was PEE all over the floor of the upstairs bathroom, and a few of my classmates went to the THIRD FLOOR, and some went to get food from the teacher who sells it. I went with the ones who went back downstairs to that bathroom, and we all were genuinely super confused?</p>
    <p>In theater we watched Cats. With a worksheet. I only scribbled Andrew Lloyd Webber and my name.</p>
    <p>RTI just worked on my paper.</p>
    <p>Bye.</p>
