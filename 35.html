    <h4>11/18/22 &#45; 7:17 PM CST &#45; Scarlet</h4>
    <h1>Good day! Also Scarlet is coming tomorrow morning but--</h1>
    <p>Progress report was all 100s and a 98 in English, science chaotic at first but boring after the teacher came back (at least I got to play on my phone when I was finished), ELA was fine (played Tetris, Amplify Grammar, edited a little of my essay (portion of the test), now 546 or so words), math boring, art fine, RTI always chaotic but I got to play on my phone (still played Tetris as well).</p>
    <p>I don't know what else to point out. Today was just a day.</p>
    <p>No spoilers.</p>
    <p>Okey bye</p>
