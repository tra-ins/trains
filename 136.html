    <h4>2/27/23 &#45; 10:32 PM EST &#45; Town Excursion</h4>
    <h1>Today was amazing.</h1>
    <p>Woke up late, went with dad and sister around and ate and stuff, silliness ensued again, we explored around the town we live(d) in, got fries and stuff from McDonaldâ€™s, went to the cupcake place, ended up at Sheetz, and left 2 hours from the start, went to Costco and Target and ate pizza with dad and sister, and got home.</p>
    <p>Bye</p>
