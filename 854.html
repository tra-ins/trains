    <h4>2/14/25 &#45; 4:39 PM CST &#45; Conjugating; Also it's Valentine's Day</h4>
    <h1>Today was fine.</h1>
    <p>In JROTC we had a sub and went to the aux gym for PT. He played the trombone in Costa Rica. In CJ we did notes. My battery pack stopped working, so that was fun. And I used up 80% of my data for the month. So that was fun. In Spanish we just chatted for half the class, then the other half we split into teams and conjugated the verbs on the board. My team lost. In Biology we did a few quizzes then more work. It's also Valentine's Day, so I did not confess to my friend who I might be crushing on! Also I'm going to start YJ s3 and maybe watch BHOBC tonight.</p>
    <p>bye! </p>
