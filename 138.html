    <h4>3/1/23 &#45; 5:23 PM CST &#45; Cuts & Cussing</h4>
    <h1>Today sucked. Wednesday, great...</h1>
    <p>Got Dunkin' in the morning, got to homeroom, said hi to the teacher, and nobody commented on my haircut [from Sunday]. Nice...</p>
    <p>Watched America: The Story of Us in social studies again, the 4th episode with John Brown or something, I don't know but the questions were very easy.</p>
    <p>Science test, again, uhh it was hard because I was ABSENT FOR TWO DAYS AND FORGOT MOST THINGS AND NEVER HAD THE TIME TO FINISH MY ESSAY!!</p>
    <p>ELA was fine, IDK if it was me or some other kid who the teacher complimented on their haircut, because when she said it, I heard that kid talking about a haircut...was probably him? ...Anyways, I have a lot of catching up to do on the PowerPoint (finished reading 5, 6, & 7 today but never finished those slides on the slideshow). Ugh.</p>
    <p>Lunch was fine, ate Dunkin', whatever, until everyone started making fun of my hairCUT (hence the cuts part of the title) and started spewing misogynistic bull--</p>
    <p>Math was very easy and everyone just sucks at finding the angles of triangles because I, THE ONE WHO WAS ABSENT FOR 2 DAYS, DID NOT STRUGGLE AT ALL AND EVEN TIMED THE TEST. 2:28:43. 2 MINUTES 28 SECONDS 43 MILLISECONDS. If I don't get 100 I'm rioting.</p>
    <p>PE was tormenting as usual. The lady came back but I forgot to ask the art teacher...welp...I hid in my spot again AND MY DUMB FRIEND KEPT CALLING OUT TO ME AND ASKED ME TO GIVE SOME KID MY NUMBER AND TOLD ME TO MAKE FRIENDS. HE CONTINUED TO MAKE FUN OF MY CUT UNTIL I WENT TO THE BATHROOM, ACTUALLY NEEDING TO GO AND JUMPSCARED HIM WHEN I CAME BACK. HE THOUGHT I WAS SKIPPING. I LITERALLY NEEDED TO GO AND HE THOUGHT I WAS SKIPPING (I ALWAYS SKIP BUT I ACTUALLY WAS USING THE BATHROOM!!!). Made fun of my haircut more until I went to the bleachers, started mindlessly pacing, drowning out the noise from around me. Some girl who I didn't notice came up to me and said something about someone else complimenting my hair? IDK but it sounded like it, and I, the one who was zoned out and only thinking about nooses and gym, was like, "huh?", and kept pacing around, and she started freaking CUSSING AND CALLING ME A DUMB WHITE GIRL AND STUFF LIKE THAT. I WAS SO CONFUSED AND DISORIENTED I DIDN'T REALIZE FULLY WHAT HAPPENED FOR A FEW MINUTES, LIKE THAT WAS SUCH A CRAZY AND ODD FEELING. Ran out of there immediately.</p>
    <p>RTI I just did the assignment I missed on Monday, was just a reading about the women's rights movement, 2nd Great Awakening, various other reforms, etc...not bad, I guess. Did some IXL until we could get on our phones.</p>
    <p>Also when I was in the gym trying to get around some kid who was blocking the way down for everyone trying to get to their buses, I tripped and fell. Great.</p>
    <p>Exercised like a GIRLBOSS GATEKEEPING GASLIGHTER. :D</p>
    <p>Wore shorts btw.</p>
    <p>Bye</p>
