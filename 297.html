    <h4>8/7/23 &#45; 1:35 PM CDT &#45; The First Day</h4>
    <h1>Uhh today was weird kinda sucked.</h1>
    <p>So I was scared and the bus wasn’t coming so I drove to school and sat in the cafeteria. Went to homeroom, it was fine, was there for 45 mins too long. Then we went to the pep rally, and one of the cheerleaders fell to the ground from the air during their routine, and they did the chubby bunny challenge. Also ppl from last year were calling my name and NO. Then we went to JROTC and my instructor just trauma dumped and gave us forms and our syllabus. After JROTC was Algebra, we did nothing. And then Culinary Arts, hopefully I’ll do the course change form and get accepted. After was Theater and I’m screwed. We have to do monologues and have scene partners. Also I was trying to look for a good seat and accidentally went the wrong way, going around someone. Woopsie daisies hehe and someone asked me what grade I’m in and then said something about me. We got called for the buses but my bus wasn’t there, the teacher had bus duty and told us to leave even though we weren’t supposed to. I was confused and just walked around aimlessly until I talked to some person about it and stayed with them for a few seconds, until we got summoned to the auditorium. And now I am home, with my sister, forgot to announce this hiatus. Funnnnn…half day by the way.</p>
    <p>Bye.</p>
