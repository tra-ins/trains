    <h4>4/6/23 &#45; 4:55 PM CDT &#45; Hunchback</h4>
    <h1>Today was okay.</h1>
    <p>Ugh we had assembly in the morning...</p>
    <p>Anyway in science, we had to write a 3 page essay from the perspective of Charles Darwin, detailing his voyage on the HMS Beagle and evolution. I wrote it like he wrote a letter to an unspecified/unknown person detailing his life, though more specifically the voyage. I didn't have enough time to finish, so I rushed through the final sentences. Oops, didn't write much about evolution itself, hahaha...but before class started, I came in early and ykw told me to not let anyone in the portable [it was raining really hard], not like I would've let anyone in anyway.</p>
    <p>In ELA, today was bucks day, but I didn't spend any. I just played Minecraft, lol. Also, this kid who told me to say 'excuse me' a couple weeks ago, was like, "why are you saying excuse me???" when I tried to politely excuse myself, because they were in my way. Girl (they were a guy).</p>
    <p>At lunch, some kid sat across from me and called me a hunchback. I get my posture is bad, but it isn't that bad...right?</p>
    <p>At math class, while my class was walking to the bathrooms, I slipped and fell outside because you know, it rained, and everyone giggled a little. I turned towards the commotion behind me, and my crush was there with their besties, and one of their besties asked me if I was okay, I said no, and my crush was like "me too girl" or something like that. AAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS...anyway, during class, the teacher asked us what the square root of 10 is. Nobody said anything, so I said that it's irrational. He asks me what number, and I turn on my calculator but end up staying silent. Later on, he asked us what an irrational number is, and I stayed silent despite knowing that they're nonrepeating, not able to be fractions, etc, but then he asks us who mentioned irrational numbers earlier [I DID]...and my class threw me under the bus. Thanks guys. He then asked me what the most commonly used irrational number or something like that is, that we've been talking about all year, and I said 'pi', because of course it's pi. And then the teacher said, "YES" and started talking about pi.</p>
    <p>During theater, the teacher couldn't make us go to the gym because the kids in PE or whoever were playing some sort of game, and it was raining outside, so the class just played charades. I just went on my phone the whole class.</p>
    <p>Uhh RTI the usual.</p>
    <p>JTA Day 31; god only knows if it can continue due to the acceptance letter</p>
    <p>bye</p>
