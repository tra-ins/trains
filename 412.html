    <h4>11/30/23 &#45; 4:45 PM CST &#45; Club Sandwich</h4>
    <h1>In theater, we went to the choir room (during first period), and I saw ex-crush, and didn't really do much. In Algebra, we didn't do anything. In Culinary, we made club sandwiches (sooo good). And in JROTC, we went outside (I sat behind JC/JROTC crush yay). Heard JC say that she liked any guy and that she liked guys, so I'm kind of doubting she likes people that aren't men so like ermmmmmmm kinda fuming but I never had a chance anyway</h1>
