    <h4>2/25/25 &#45; 4:43 PM CST &#45; I Finished Two Books Today</h4>
    <h1>Today was okay.</h1> 
    <p>In JROTC I read and we launched rockets. In CJ we did more notes. In Spanish I finished Merrick and worked on our project. In Biology we did notes and made a triangle food chain thing. And I finished reading Nevada on the bus home.</p>
