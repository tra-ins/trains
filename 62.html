    <h4>12/15/22 &#45; 4:50 PM CST &#45; McKinley</h4>
    <h1>Today was excellent. Amazing Thursday, did literally nothing.</h1>
    <p>In social studies we did an extra credit sweater of a historical figure or era. At first I was gonna do WW1 or Grover Cleveland--WAIT I COULD'VE DONE THE VICTORIAN ERA HELPPPP; But I decided on William McKinley, even though I do not like William McKinley. Teacher is proud of my work, I feel validated. Full Dinner Pail. In ELA it was the marble reward party day, my class got last and we couldn't get our phones out, but at least we got food [like hot Cheetos, cookies, etc], drinks, and to play on our laptops and Uno. Also Gnomeo and Juliet was on but I wasn't paying attention. In math we got hot chocolate, donuts, cookies, and marshmallows and watched The Polar Express. For art, we just went to the band room, Star Wars was playing on the projector, and I just played on my phone and laptop. RTI was RTI but when I actually finished that sweater.</p>
    <p>10/10 day, got to gang up and smack my friend with my lunchbox during lunch.</p>
    <p>Update: I tried Popeyes for the first time for dinner. It was okay. Just okay.</p>
    <p>byeeeee</p>
