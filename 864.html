    <h4>2/24/25 &#45; 4:49 PM CST &#45; Another Round of Disappointment yet not being Shocked</h4>
    <h1>Today was ok.</h1> 
    <p>In JROTC I read while everyone made rockets (again). In CJ we learned about impaired driving (again). In Spanish, we worked on our projects, and I was a bit disappointed at the people in my class's ignorance but it's not really that shocking. Anyway. In Biology we did notes about photosynthesis and cellular respiration.</p>
