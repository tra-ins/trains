    <h4>8/8/25 &#45; 4:39 PM CDT &#45; i became a t.a.</h4>
    <h1>school was interesting?</h1> 
    <p>Ok. Homeroom played pokemon ranger shadows of almia. English did work for a participation grade until I got called down to guidance about my schedule. Here's where things get interesting. I have to get out of CJ 3 and do it next year instead, so I needed a new 2nd block class. I also can't be in DE Speech because I didn't choose it, so 4th period is just a free, library period for me. I get offered by my guidance counselor to be a TA for the Special Ed class. I visit the class. I go to CJ and decide on which class to take. African American History, Ancient History, Culinary II, AV Production, or TA. I choose to TA. The counselor comes up and hands me my schedule and all 5 of us leave to our new classes. I sit in the new class for 30 minutes and watch everyone, without a clue on what to do. I do give the lunch ladies some papers or something. This will be interesting. 3rd block did math math math gahhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!! 4th block (library block basically) I just watched IWTV and played a bit of pokemon ranger. I really doubt that I'll be a good T.A. so I am very nervous.</p>
    <p>bye</p>
