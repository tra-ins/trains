    <h4>9/19/23 &#45; 4:37 PM CDT &#45; Be Sure to Ride the Cyclone (I love ride the cyclone so so much mmmm yummy)</h4>
    <h1>today was whatever</h1>
    <p>In JROTC we did things, I don't really care. In Algebra, we did Algebra. In Culinary, we did an open note test, and got more papers got (I got 19 questions wrong on that chapter 10 test lol). In theater, we had a sub, so we had to choose 3 prompts and write monologues or scenes of them, and I somehow finished it in time. Yay. Hopefully my mom watches RIDE THE CYCLONE with me today. Please.</p>
    <p>Bye</p>
