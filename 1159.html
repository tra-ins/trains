SMT. i hate video game sbecause i encountered a game breaking bug in the og unofficial english translation of the snes version of smt 1 that i cannot fix because idk how to export the save file from the game cuz it's played via a snes9x forwarder on my 3ds and i dont see it in jksm or anywhere! so i cant even finisht ehd amn game!!!!! ive been playing it since september it hink!!!!!!!!!!!! i was near the end too!!!!!! pardon my language but this pisses me off, to say the least. what am i supposed tod o now. watch someone finish the gaem. move onto smt 2 or kmt which might also have a game breaking bug idk how to fix. just play smt iv or soul hackers? i dunno. i dun no. maybe one day ill play the psx version. but smt 1 is kinda a slog to play. i like it but the amount of save states i end up using.... much more than persona 1..... rant over. update 1 day later i figured it out and now i can progress</p>
