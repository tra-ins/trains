    <h1>today eh</h1>
    <p>In JROTC, I failed my final exam, but it's okay because Major said he wouldn't let me fail it (istg if he lied...) (I WILL NEVER SEE JC AGAIN BROOOO). And in Algebra, we already did our final project thing, so we did nothing. And then I left school early. Yeah. Hiatus time!!!</p>
