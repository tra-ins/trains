    <h4>9/13/24 &#45; 4:54 PM CDT &#45; It's the 700th Update! And Friday the 13th I Suppose</h4>
    <h1>Today was fine.</h1>
    <p>In Criminal Justice true crime podcaster/investigators came in as guest speakers and told us about this case. In Geometry we had free time, so I tried to finish my missing assignments for English. In English I finished my benchmark, turned in one of my assignments, and started one that I finished during Spanis class. In Spanish we did a Gimkit and a quiz and such.</p>
    <p>Bye</p>
