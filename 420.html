    <h4>12/8/23 &#45; 4:33 PM CST &#45; Match</h4>
    <h1>today ok</h1>
    <p>In JROTC, we did nothing, though JC gave me a free ticket to the wrestling match (I asked her) (she HANDED it to me) (keeping the half-ticket forever). In Algebra we did nothing. In Culinary, we made broccoli salad, and it was alright??? I liked it???? Also, my friend (other than my lab partner) and I bonded over Butch 4 Butch by Rio Romeo (MY FAVORITE SONG!!! SHE HAD IT IN A PLAYLIST!!!) (we bonded over Girl in Red the day before). And in theater, I went to the wrestling match and witnessed my school's team (probably) lose, and JC lose her round. But it's okay because I got to watch her and the other women wrestle (my heart was racing ok) (ugh the men were so boring).</p>
    <p>Bye</p>
