    <h4>12/19/22 &#45; 5:17 PM CST &#45; Factory</h4>
    <h1>Today was great! 10/10, barely any work was done and started building my Minecraft factory!</h1>
    <p>In social studies, I just played Tetris and began the factory later in class. My English teacher wasn't here today, and won't be here tomorrow so I had go to split list to the other English teacher, who coincidentally was hosting her Christmas party!!! There was hot chocolate, bagels and cream cheese, cookies, chips, soda, and other stuff. I just continued the factory and took advantage of the situation. I think there's a packet we're supposed to do but we [my split list] just...never got it. Oops? Whatever, math was easy and It wasn't terrible. Art gave me traumatic memories of my old future letter to self but except this time it's for Senior me. Yay? RTI was RTI.</p>
    <p>Random uninteresting story: at the end of math, my math teacher made us have to finish like one math problem [IT WAS EASY, MIGHT I ADD] to be able to leave. I finished pretty quickly and was confused why everyone was still writing. The rest of my class going to art didn't get there for a couple minutes. I am sobbing.</p>
    <p>Got extra credit for the open note test, so now I can pretend that I got a hundred on it [I already had a hundred in the class] [credit from the sweater assignment].</p>
    <p>One last thing, I thought I almost missed the bus because I was in the bathroom for like 15 minutes having Flamin' Hot--nevermind, but the bus came like right when I went in the car. At like 7:40 AM [pretty late].</p>
    <p>bye</p>
