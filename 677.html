    <h4>8/21/24 &#45; 4:37 PM CDT &#45; It Wasn't Picture Day?</h4>
    <h1>Today was meh.</h1>
    <p>Criminal Justice we learned about the UCR, Geometry we did nothing (I got a 29.5/30 on the test). English we read more of Farenheit 451 (I like it so far!!!). And Spanish, we learned about the time and stuff like that. I thought they said Picture Day was today??? But it wasn't. So. Alsoooo 1 more month untill--okay never mind.</p>
    <p>bye</p>
