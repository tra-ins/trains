    <h4>10/2/23 &#45; 4:58 PM CDT &#45; Eraser</h4>
    <h1>today was midddd</h1>
    <p>In JROTC, my instructor just talked about goals and stuff, and my pencil and eraser disappeared. Like, I left to go to the bathroom, and when I went back in the other classroom to retrieve my pencil and eraser, they were gone. And then I left another pencil in the main classroom. In Algebra, we just talked about growth and decay again. In Culinary, we did a study guide (haven't finished the MATH yet) for the midterms. And in theater, we finished writing our monologues (the teacher read mine and said he loved it & I was giggling the entire time).</p>
    <p>that's all, bye</p>
