    <h4>5/10/24 &#45; 4:29 PM CDT &#45; One Hour Delay</h4>
    <h1>Today was okay.</h1>
    <p>There was a one hour delay but I still overslept a bit. AP World did jeapordy, English wrote a letter to my future self, Science did a Blooket, JROTC did nothing. Then the Senior Walk happened and I had to say goodbye to JC. I'll miss yearning for her. I probably still will though. After, I ate lunch, and then went back to Science and worked on that science project, and then went to JROTC and worked on it, and got fitted for OCPs.</p>
    <p>Bye</p>
