    <h4>10/2/24 &#45; 4:57 PM CDT &#45; PLEASE CAN MY TEACHER GRADE MY ESSAY</h4>
    <h1>Criminal Justice we did a quiz. Geometry I rewatched IWTV and I watched The Addams Family. English we finished reading Night. Please can my teacher grade my essay. I have an 84 in English this quarter. At lunch, I was reading The Vampire Lestat, specifically near the end of Marius telling Lestat his story, when a staff member/teacher came up to me and looked over at my book and loudly asked me what I was reading. She then was like, "YOU READ THE VAMPIRE DIARIES [I was reading a book from The Vampire Chronicles, so that further confused me] OR SOEMTHING?" and I didn't reply so she left. Spanish I got an A on a test. While waiting for my bus, someone who looked familiar came up to me and asked me how I was doing. I looked at her and I said that I was doing okay, and she left. I was confused, but I wasn't mad or bothered. I smiled at her.</h1>
    <p>Bye</p>
