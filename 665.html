    <h4>8/9/24 &#45; 4:45 PM CDT &#45; I Missed the Bus. Again.</h4>
    <h1>Today was meh.</h1>
    <p>Criminal Justice we put our fingerprints on balloons and blew them up. Did I mention I don't know how to blow a balloon? So the teacher did it for me. Geometry we learned about lines and stuff. English we started this poem thing, it was annoying but I managed to write some. Spanish we learned the colors, shapes, and some animals in Spanish.</p> 
    <p>also i missed the bus again okay bye</p>
