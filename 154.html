    <h4>3/17/23 &#45; 4:50 PM CDT &#45; Saint Patrick's Day</h4>
    <h1>Today was decent.</h1>
    <p>The only green clothes I found in my wardrobe was my picture day clothes, so uhhh...yeah...oh no...ACTUALLY NOW WHEN TYPING THIS I JUST FOUND A VEST I'VE NEVER WORN THAT HAD SOME GREEN ON IT. I HATE MY LIFE.</p>
    <p>I got pinched 3 times today and they were from 2 annoying people ("friend" and some kid) and a ykw girl. All in homeroom. Had to tell "friend" to shut up many times, especially homeroom and science. At least my homeroom teacher tried giving me a green hairband, didn't work, got a green triangle from her and changed my watchface to a picture of a mini Sprite at the nail salon (Sunday or Saturday I forgor when), which is indeed green.</p>
    <p>Anyway, in science, the substitute teacher did give me a green square (thanks bestie) (also she was awesome and super chill), there was work on Teams I didn't know existed until I heard 2 people point it out. I didn't want to do it so I didn't do it, even though it is worth 500 points, haha! It looks annoying and difficult so I just played ABCya and MC.</p>
    <p>ELA marble reward party!! Finally, my block (class) got the most marbles out of all of the other blocks!! We voted 9-8 (I think) yesterday for tacos, so we had some banger tacos and other food. Was peaceful, teacher asked me how my day was going and told me about (and told nobody else) & offered more cookies but never went through with it. Also lunch I was bothered but not that much, I guess.</p>
    <p>Uhh I got 100 on the translations test, and did the reflections test. Easy math.</p>
    <p>In PE we played dodgeball, I was selected (NOT LAST LOL) on a team and the girl who chose me asked if I could throw, I asked her if we had to play, she said no, and I ran and yelled "byeeee!!". Amazing. Watched friendships tear apart.</p>
    <p>RTI was nice, we didn't have to do IXL (I already finished the ones we were supposed to do anyway), so I just texted, listened to music, and worked on my MC world. That Minecraft world is so amazing, I've put so much effort into it, the plantation is beautiful with no implications, the skyscraper is in progress, the 1st out of 2 graveyards is stunning, the sloop in the unfinished dock sways in the wind, etc :D</p>
    <p>Came home earlier because the h school went home early (after their 2nd block?) because of their midterms, lol. Around 4:03 PM!</p>
    <p>Rizz Status: I think I've received full enough confirmation that my crush is indeed dating that guy that I heard was dating them like a month or 2 ago. Still no rizz tho, lol.</p>
    <p>JTA Day 11.</p>
    <p>Bye.</p>
