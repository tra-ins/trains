    <h1>Today was meh.</h1>
    <p>Criminal Justice learned about stuff like bag limits and types of birds. Geometry did benchmark. Did not even have enough time to finish it. English finished The Monkey's Paw assignment and barely started the socratic seminar questions. I'm not passing that socratic seminar. Spanish did the Chapter 4 test.</p>
