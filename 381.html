    <h4>10/30/23 &#45; 4:44 PM CDT &#45; B-18</h4>
    <h1>today was fine</h1>
    <p>Before we went to class, they gave the first 48 of us free coffee in the breakfast line, though it was disgusting. In JROTC, I worked on my B-18 presentation. In Algebra, I did test review. In Culinary, we cut potatoes (didn't get to eat them though). In theater, we did this types of stages thing.</p>
