    <h4>12/16/22 &#45; 4:56 PM CST &#45; Field Trip</h4>
    <h1>Today was interesting...</h1>
    <p>We left for the field trip to the nearby college at what would be during 1st period, and my friend [who was my exit buddy, we all had to have one :(] kept being annoying and stole my schedule. I had Sales & Marketing, Engineering, and Counseling [gave info about the h school] in that order, based off of results from some career test we did earlier in the year. I wasn't interested in any of them, I guess sort of marketing, but do I look like an engineer to you? Sales & Marketing was kind of boring, but at least I had the class with my friend. Engineering was boring and I was practically asleep while the civil engineer guy was talking. On the way back, my friend just slept on the bus even though it was a basically 5 minute ride. Also, one of the classes in my grade missed us so they had to come later. When we got back, we went to 2nd period [English] and I just played Tetris on my laptop and my teacher gave us leftover cookies from the party yesterday.</p>
    <p>Lunch was boring and miserable, and I was very tired and annoyed at that point. After the rest of English class [after lunch], we went to math class and FINALLY, WE'RE LEARNING FUNCTIONS. I HATE MATH BUT I WAS CURIOUS ABOUT FUNCTIONS. I WAS BEGGING AND PLEADING TO LEARN FUNCTIONS, AND FINALLY, FINALLY!!!! WE'RE STARTING FUNCTIONS :))))! After math, we watched the school's production of Annie and I really don't know what to feel about Annie. It doesn't make sense to me. Like why did Oliver Warbucks just want to adopt Annie and then help her find her parents [who are later found out to be dead] after like the first day? Or am I missing a lot because it was a 1 hour school production of a musical. I love Ms. Hannigan and the dog named Sandy [that was played by some guy], who only showed up when Annie was out and got caught by the police guy. TOMORROW, TOMORROW, TOMORROW-- OKAY BUT THE LITTLE GIRL SONG WITH MS. HANNIGAN WAS A MASTERPIECE, TRULY THE SONG OF ALL TIME. I TOO HATE LITTLE GIRLS! Actually, my favorite part was when FDR said, "It's New Dealing time," and New Dealed all over. Truly the New Deal of all time!</p>
    <p>Yep, today was today. It was a day! A Friday.</p>
    <p>bye</p>
