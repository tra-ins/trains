    <h4>12/9/22 &#45; 5:16 PM CST &#45; No Art</h4>
    <h1>Today was okay, except for the end of the day.</h1>
    <p>In science, we had to write a 4 page research paper about radar. Don't worry, I finished it at the end of class. ELA was bucks day, I finished the work so I just played Tetris for half an hour. Math was math, at least we're now on substitution. The art teacher was there, but for some reason she made us go to PE and I stood there for 40 minutes watching the time on my watch. RTI was RTI.</p>
    <p>The assembly was okay, the high school choir performed an acapella or something.</p>
    <p>Uhhh, I don't have many more things to say.</p>
    <p>Bye.</p>
