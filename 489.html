    <h4>2/15/24 &#45; 4:51 PM CST &#45; No Hate Tour</h4>
    <h1>Today sucks as well x2.</h1>
    <p>AP World I played Minesweeper and we went to a Marines thing in the gym called the No Hate Tour, and there were like BMX bikers and it felt like they were trying to recruit us for the Marines (probably were, seemed like propaganda but I digress). We went back to AP World after and stayed longer, then went to English and started reading The Odyssey. In Science we did a sort thing. And in JROTC, we finished watching Apollo 13.</p>
