    <h1>today was also boring but the international adventures thing is like 6K so ermmm no thank you</h1>
    <p>In JROTC we did an inspection (smh I wore the wrong t-shirt underneath again). In Algebra we did math, and in Culinary I finished everything already so I just went on my phone. In theater we had to recite a joke to the class sitting in the far back of the theater, and I think I did okay. That's really it, though the time when I sat in the very front of the theater to wait for my bus, some kid started bugging me and calling me 'lady' (:/), and made me feel super uncomfortable, so I went to the bathroom and then came back and sat away. also scarlet and violet dlc part 1 today?????!!!</p>
    <p>yea bye</p>
