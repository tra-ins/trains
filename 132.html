    <h4>2/23/23 &#45; 6:04 PM CST &#45; Scheduling</h4>
    <h1>Today was interesting</h1>
    <p>Social studies- anxious about a question or two on an assignment, but the rest was easy. Worked on MC factory world.</p>
    <p>ELA was ok.</p>
    <p>At lunch we just played Uno. Everyone made the teacher mad because we left the room too early without her.</p>
    <p>Uhh math the teacher just explained stuff about scheduling for h school, which was later today.</p>
    <p>PE sucks but I just paced around the bleachers since people were crowding my secluded hiding place.</p>
    <p>RTI was RTI, just worked on the MC factory world.</p>
    <p>It was like 80 degrees today and I wore shorts and a shirt from my old school.</p>
    <p>Went to Dollar General, got some Sprite, went to the h school, scheduled. Doing Advanced English, regular Algebra I, Physical Science, AP World History, JROTC, Theater Arts (until I get an instrument for Band), POS: Criminal Justice with alternative AFJROTC, electives: 1. Business; 2. Human Studies; 3. Computer Applications (business but computering); 4. Contempory/Ancient History. Talked to one of the assistant principals and the band teacher. Bassoons are like 10k so...well...time to figure out a cheaper instrument...and talk to the band teacher at my school...great...at least he likes Tetris...</p>
    <p>I will be stressed next year!!! :DDD Thank you mother and asssistant principal lady for making me do ADVANCED ENGLISH. I wanted to do AP World History so it's ok :)</p>
    <p>bye</p>
