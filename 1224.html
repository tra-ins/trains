    <p>I love watching it fly in the air and your vision of it becomes a circle tjat gets all dark and smudged and you feel the cool air hit your back and hear the buzz and you find yourself beaming in delight because with the camera you are King of All The Land (400 ft high at least) and you move the camera w the gimble thingymabob and zoom in and out with a bird's eye view . That is what it must be like to enter heaven</p>
    <p>I flew it above the football field and got to demonstrate it to jrotc chief because jrotc class was outside and he was curious!! And there was a camera and I felt like a bee. !</p>
