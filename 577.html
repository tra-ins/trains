    <h4>5/13/24 &#45; 4:57 PM CDT &#45; AP Exam on the 15th!</h4>
    <h1>Today was mediocre.</h1>
    <p>AP World did something. I am studying folks. Trust me (I'm cooked though. I have 2 days until the exam.). English wrote my name in cursive. Science won a game of Bingo. JROTC didn't do anything.</p>
    <p>Bye</p>
