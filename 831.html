    <h4>1/22/25 &#45; 4:39 PM CST &#45; THANK THE LORD x2</h4>
    <h1>Today was fine x2.</h1>
    <p>We had a 2 hour delay today! I got to wake up at 8:30. It felt so freeing. And our unit-wide inspection was postponed to after April. We kind of just stood around the big room the whole time. In CJ we learned about verbal communication. In Spanish we did more work. And we did more work in Biology, too.</p>
