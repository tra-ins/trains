    <h4>12/13/22 &#45; 5:16 PM CST &#45; Stoppage</h4>
    <h1>Today was okay.</h1>
    <p>Science crossword, ELA R&J, math was math, art was a goofy present box thing we didn't finish but I somehow messed up the folding and it's extremely crooked, and RTI was RTI.</p>
    <p>The bus randomly had a stoppage at the high school, again. Like we were just waiting inside for a couple minutes, then went outside and switched buses.</p>
    <p>BYE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
