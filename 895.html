    <h4>3/27/25 &#45; 5:00 PM CDT &#45; Reflexive Verbs</h4>
    <h1>Today was okay.</h1> 
    <p>In JROTC we talked about space or something. Wasn't paying much attention. In CJ we learned about tactical entry. In Spanish my partner and I from the 2 previous projects (the conversation and travel agency) had to recite our conversation. And we have to add to it each week. And the video project is due in May. I just did my work on reflexive verbs. On the way to Biology I ended up walking close to that pretty girl in my class. I was scared. I'm scared. I must admit, I am a bit terrified of girls I find pretty, especially ones my mind has forced me to fixate on. That is embarrassing. I swear, I can't tell anyone dumb things like this though. Nobody (my two friends that now thinking about it I consider to be my current ultimate best friends) cares or can relate much. I also only have unkind words for my ex/former (?) bff. Sorry.</p>
    <p>bye</p>
