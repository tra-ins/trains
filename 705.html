    <h4>9/18/24 &#45; 4:55 PM CDT &#45; Wait, Alright, the Essay is Due Tomorrow and I May Actually Finish it</h4>
    <h1>Today was boring.</h1>
    <p>In Criminal Justice we talked about reasonable expectation of privacy. In Geometry we talked about congruency again. In English we continued our essays, and we have a socratic seminar tomorrow. Help. And in Spanish, we did a Gimkit and a quiz, and I got delante de and detras de mixed up. Delante de is in front and detras de is behind. I mostly just focused on my essay though, but I did have to answer a question because my name got picked in a cup (I got it right).</p>
    <p>Bye</p>
