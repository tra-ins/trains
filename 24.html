    <h4>11/7/22 &#45; 6:26 PM CST &#45; The Bell</h4>
    <h1>Monday that was off for a teacher professional development day!</h1>
    <p>Went to Dave N' Busters with my mom, exchanged tickets for a bell, and yeah that's really it!</p>
    <p>Yay, a good day!</p>
    <p>I don't have anything else to say, but Pop the Lock and Connect 4 Hoops are the best and superior games.</p>
    <p>Bye</p>
