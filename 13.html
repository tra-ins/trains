    <h1>Tomorrow is the day of reckoning...</h1>
    <p>ANYWAY! I GOT TO MISS SOCIAL STUDIES TO CONTINUE THESE TESTS FROM A FEW WEEKS AGO! BOOO I ACTUALLY WANTED TO WATCH THE SHOW BUT WHATEVER...</p>
    <p>The Landlady!!! Omg I love Roald Dahl (because of Matilda) (that's only really why), yeah we read it and watched a video of it in English class.</p>
    <p>I love how my math teacher spent most of the class showing us the Job Corps and the Peace Corps and telling us that we should be prepared for college or something...</p>
    <p>Farewell! (I said farewell upon leaving Social Studies shhh)</p>
