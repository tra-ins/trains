    <h4>3/14/23 &#45; 5:11 PM CDT &#45; The Day That Krabs Fries</h4>
    <h1>March 14th! Wait that's not right. It should say..."The Day That Krabs Fries"!</h1>
    <h1>Uhh oh yeah happy White Day, Pi Day, whatever, today was decent.</h1>
    <p>When I walked out of the gym, 2 teachers complimented my black and white patterned collared shirt and yellow diamond patterned tie. In homeroom, when I arrived at the door, the ELA teacher and social studies teacher complimented my outfit immediately and asked what the occasion, and of course I was like "idk why not" [what I replied to everyone asking]. My social studies teacher emailed me the actual yearbook link, thank God, and I sat down minding my own business. People came and asked about it, complimented, throughout the rest of homeroom.</p>
    <p>Science I have a project to finish later but I don't want to. I finished most of it, just need to color, but I don't feel like it. Also got complimented by the science teacher and too asked about it, and this one annoying guy kept asking throughout the day (not my "friend", who would bother me as well). Started to have a silly period emergency which would kill me throughout the day.</p>
    <p>ELA threw my dad under the bus since it was technically him who made me apply for the magnet school, and joked w/ teacher. Started chapter 9 summary, RIP.</p>
    <p>I think someone had an anxiety attack or something during lunch, witnessed that behind me, pretty much all that happened at lunch.</p>
    <p>Math, the usual boredom, but during the bathroom break that annoying guy kept asking about it and I didn't say anything so this girl next to me made him shut up (and complimented me, said it looked amazing or something, I forgot exactly). A fight occured right after math was over but I was too far away from the action. I heard screaming and didn't look back, but was confused when people ran in the door behind me (I held the door) talking about a fight, which will be more significant later on in this update.</p>
    <p>Period 7 PE was great because we didn't do anything because of the STEAM fair and I just figured out I could go on my laptop. However, before, I asked the teacher to go to the bathroom, said yes, and RAN in a stall. I got jumpscared by some girls who left soon after, and while readjusting my blood-stained outfit a WHOLE group of girls came in and talked about the fight and other stuff, and asked me questions (I obviously had no clue about it. I think I know one of the people who was in it, unless it was a different person with the same name, because they're in my class). Played Tetris & MC after. Also, when I came in the gym, some annoying pajama pants wearing girl kept complimenting my outfit in some way but I ignored her like the jerk I am, LOL.</p>
    <p>RTI (no extra PE) IXL for a couple minutes, was allowed to stop at like 3:00 (15/10 minutes after) and just played MC a little and went on my phone. Heard more about the fight, I guess. It's so weird...IDK.</p>
    <p>I still have no rizz w/ my crush & all D:</p>
    <p>JTA Day 8.</p>
    <p>Bye.</p>
