    <h4>3/29/23 &#45; 4:53 PM CDT &#45; Gushing & Crushing 4 the Billionth Time</h4>
    <h1>Today was decent.</h1>
    <p>Yellow vest & tie with black shirt & pants time!!! Social studies, we watched JOHN GREEN I LOVE JOHN GREEN!!!! Anyway, we watched his Crash Course US History video about westward expansion, I think, because the computers weren't charged. We did manage to play the Oregon Trail, but I died :(</p>
    <p>Science, just did questions and stuff, left my phone at social studies again by accident and the teacher complimented my outfit :D</p>
    <p>ELA, was easy enough and I answered a question about Frederick Douglass (what we've been doing in class), woo, yay vest compliments from teacher and even nail color compliment from teacher :)</p>
    <p>Math test! Didn't finish but it wasn't bad, finally figured out rotations I hope?</p>
    <p>Theater!! Finished my speech.</p>
    <p>RTI! No IXL, teacher complimented my outfit :D, just played Tetris and stuff on my phone, it was actually ykw's bday today so I said happy birthday, again, and I think they got Snapchat, but they QUICKADDED ME??? SHOULD I ACCEPT? UM...well I did punch and shove my "friend" because he was harrassing me in the gym :D (lightly)</p>
    <p>I keep thinking about my crush, ughhhh I wish I could talk to them some day, or at least get their number or Snap if they have it :( I heard they're going to the so called magnet school? IDK but they themself didn't say it so I don't know.</p>
    <p>I don't feel like adding back the rizz status, because it will never happen.</p>
    <p>JTA Day 23; god only knows if it can continue due to the acceptance letter</p>
    <p>bye</p>
