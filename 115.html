    <h4>2/6/23 &#45; 4:51 PM CST &#45; Skipping</h4>
    <h1>Today was mediocre + I WILL TRY ZAXBY'S AGAIN BUT THIS TIME MY SOCIAL STUDIES TEACHER'S GO-TO ORDER THERE!!! I'M SORRY MY FRIEND AND MY SOCIAL STUDIES TEACHER; I HEARD THAT THE SPICY CHICKEN SANDWICH ISN'T THE BEST SOOOO... love u ms [her name] i love her sm unless she screws up the civil war unit then i will personally break into her home and break every single piece of glass one by one and then defenestrate her</h1>
    <p>New social studies notes; southern society in the antebe--Oh God. I hope she doesn't say something about "states' rights" in the Civil War unit, because THAT IS HISTORICALLY INACCURATE MA'AM. Anyway, she also indirectly gave me the idea to make a plantation right next to the MC factory, which is weird but it'll be my own private plantation! With modern slavery (instead of enslaving basically anyone who isn't white or something, it'll be EVERYONE. In poverty? You're in luck--or unluck)!</p>
    <p>Uhh ELA unit test--probably failed or a B. I really wasn't confident with a couple of the questions and uhh uhm IT WAS DIFFICULT, OKAY. Math was easy functions stuff, also my teacher explained his life story of working at K-Mart in 1985 or something.</p>
    <p>No 7th period; had an assembly where it's this Jump Rope for Heart/Kids Heart Challenge or Boosterthon Fun Run-esque thing but except it definitely is a pyramid scheme, but whatever, I'm still going to get 20+ contacts so I can get the cool prizes AND possibly a $250 Amazon gift card or mini fridge stuffed with cash. I probably won't win, but who caresss, I'll still get some flying pig thing I guess.</p>
    <p>Extra PE: Walked out and stared at the wall and these people kinda just came up and harassed me? Like let me stare at the wall and sneak-check my phone every once in the while in peace; ended up hiding in the bathroom for 5-6 minutes (I timed it), didn't stay for longer so it wouldn't look like I was skipping (hence the title + silly classmate saw me standing in the middle of the room near a sink and asked if I was skipping (I was like no, but they said it was fine, and then I said "I wish" and then was like "bye bye"). Went back outside but just stared at the bleachers instead.</p>
    <p>Weird day I guess.</p>
    <p>Bye.</p>
