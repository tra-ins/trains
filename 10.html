    <h4>10/22/22 &#45; 5:19 PM CDT &#45; Powerful</h4>
    <h1>The debate wasn't bad!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</h1>
    <p>Yo, I think my group might win!!! WE WILL WIN. THE TITLE OF THE NEXT UPDATE DEPENDS ON THE RESULTS!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
    <p>I HAVE NEVER FINISHED THE CURRENT CHAPTERS OF DELTARUNE BUT BIG SHOT FLOWS IN MY VEINSSSSSSS!!!!</p>
    <p>Basically, I was the opening argument and we switched to versing this team that was STRONG, but I still had hope we could win [despite the fact I told the rebuttals person on my team "best of luck"]. I KNEW I had to have a good impression on the judge (my teacher) by passionately opening and pleading with yelling and expressions of emotions, I started loud but fast (my classmates were laughing AND WERE ACTUALLY SCARED, causing me to laugh 'cause even I didn't expect myself to be THAT loud), and my teacher told me to be a little quieter OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, so I went a little slower and put emphasis on parts while trying to make Victor's creation sound in the right.</p>
    <p>Oh yeah, my English teacher said I was fantastic, and leaving lunch she said it was powerful [THE TITLE OF THE UPDATE] :))))))))))))))))))))</p>
    <p>Also today was great except for period 7 [ART] and period 8 [RTI, extra PE on Mondays and Tuesdays]. My art teacher wasn't here and she told us we'd have a sub, so I was confused when nobody was in the classroom, therefore I went to PE. AN HOUR OF SITTING OUTSIDE LONELY, YOU KNOW, AT LEAST THEY DIDN'T MAKE US [MY ART CLASS] DO THE WORKOUTS IN PERIOD 7!!!!!!</p>
