    <h4>12/6/23 &#45; 4:27 PM CST &#45; Caesar Salad</h4>
    <h1>today mid as well</h1>
    <p>In JROTC, we didn't really do anything. In Algebra, we finished our EOCs, and I missed the opportunity to get Laufey tickets that aren't THREE HUNDRED dollars. In Culinary, we made caesar salad (?) (idk if it was caesar salad but it was good??? I don't even like cheese, and there was so much cheese in the mayo mixture sauce and the salad itself), and I missed the opportunity to get Mitski tickets that are within my budget (WAITLIST SALE AT THE WORST TIME.). And in theater, we worked on our final projects.</p>
    <p>bye</p>
