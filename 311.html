    <h4>8/21/23 &#45; 4:53 PM CDT &#45; Cry No. 2</h4>
    <h1>Today was actually horrendous.</h1>
    <p>I stayed up all night. And then I went to school. The JROTC instructor started talking about this poor kid's death last week. And then we take pictures. And I have a confrontation with the guy I was "friends" with. And then I get my picture. It's ugly. I don't care enough to retake. I get confused of where to go. I finally figure it out after wandering around aimlessly for 10 minutes. I sit down. I miss when the class goes back. I start realizing that and run to the bathroom and cry for 20-30 minutes. I come back to class while the guest speaker is there. He tells us about how his basic training or whtever group was called the "fab 5" (like Queer Eye or sm???) and how he was a Twitch streamer. I go to Algebra. It's fine. Culinary Arts is fine too, just gives a sense of foreboding. Theater we do some silly warm up and then ANOTHER partner acting game.</p>
    <p>That's all.</p>
    <p>bye</p>
