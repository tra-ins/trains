    <h4>8/26/24 &#45; 4:40 PM CDT &#45; Conformity or Whatever</h4>
    <h1>Today was fine.</h1>
    <p>Criminal Justice we learned about the Crime Control Model vs the Due Process Model. Geometry we learned about triangles. English we read an article about why people conform or something. Spanish we learned new words! And people fought I don't know I don't care whenever people physically fight.</p>
    <p>Yeah bye</p>
