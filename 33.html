    <h1>Great day. That's really it.</h1>
    <p>Played Tetris in social studies (I have a hundred in the class and also my teacher gave the 5 points for the one question I missed on the test. Don't remember the map where I forgot to label the bat-). Science was fine. ELA was the first part of a test, not too difficult. Math was boring as always. Art was cool, RTI was RTI.</p>
    <p>So my mom had a meeting with the silly Gifted program or whatever at 2 PM (while I was in art class), and uhh IQ 121 doesn't matter, YAYYYYYYYYYY I DIDN'T GET IN BECAUSE I SUCK AT CREATIVE THINKING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WOOHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!! (This isn't sarcasm, this is purely my thoughts and feelings. I am truly excited and overjoyed to not be in such a thing again.)</p>
    <p>Ok bye</p>
