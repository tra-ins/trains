    <h4>9/26/24 &#45; 4:45 PM CDT &#45; Have You All Read Night?</h4>
    <h1>Criminal Justice a wildlife resource officer came in and we're going to start training to get hunting licenses! Geometry we learned about how opposite the largest angles are the largest sides of triangles and vice versa. English we read Chapter 2 and 3 of Night. Spanish we did a quiz and learned more. I've been asking everyone I know if they've read Night, lol.</h1>
