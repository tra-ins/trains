    <h4>10/27/23 &#45; 4:41 PM CDT &#45; No Prize</h4>
    <h1>today was meh</h1>
    <p>In JROTC, we did PT stuff. In Algebra, we did this fish thing and I got every question but one right (I NEVER LEARNED HOW TO CLASSIFY POLYNOMIALS BECAUSE I WAS BUSY TAKING MY MIDTERM). In Culinary, we cut things with a butter knife and our playdough (we got to keep the playdough we made, but I have no clue what to do with mine). In theater, my teacher put on Shrek the Musical while people finished their projects (my theater teacher last year already put on Shrek the Musical so I didn't watch it). THEY DIDN'T ANNOUNCE THE WINNERS FOR THE MOLE THING DURING OT?????? I WANT MY PRIZE!!!!</p>
    <p>ok bye</p>
