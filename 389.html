    <h4>11/7/23 &#45; 4:42 PM CST &#45; Mac N Cheese</h4>
    <h1>today was alright</h1>
    <p>In JROTC, I presented my presentation near the end of class, and my instructor called it the best this semester. In Algebra, we did algebra or something. In Culinary, we made Mac & Cheese, and it was alright (rip my lab partner she's lactose intolerant). And in theater, we did more like sets stuff with like making maps of them or whatever.</p>
    <p>ok bye</p>
