    <h4>1/31/24 &#45; 4:41 PM CST &#45; Missing T-Shirt</h4>
    <h1>Today sucks.</h1>
    <p>In AP World we did a test that I probably failed. In English we continued reading The Most Dangerous Game. In Physical Science we did a test, got a C...40/55 (3 questions wrong...). In JROTC, we did inspection, and actually earlier in the day I couldn't find my white t-shirt and couldn't pin my bangs up, because my mom's been gone a while and IDK how to do so. Plus ran out of time because of my panic. Anyway didn't even matter we were all given a free pass. Also saw JC outside because of the fire drill. I think she's a band kid HELPPPP...</p>
    <p>goodbye</p>
