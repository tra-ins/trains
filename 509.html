    <h4>3/6/24 &#45; 4:51 PM CST &#45; LEQ</h4>
    <h1>Today sucked.</h1>
    <p>AP World started doing an LEQ practice, midterms are next week, I have 2 days to do a newspaper assignment, I'm screwed. Won another Quizizz though. English won 2 Kahoots back to back. Science watched Bill Nye. JROTC did an inspection and stuff.</p>
