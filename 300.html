    <h4>8/10/23 &#45; 5:01 PM CDT &#45; The Fourth Day (ft. kinda coming out)</h4>
    <h1>Once again a bad day.</h1>
    <p>Nothing to talk about in homeroom, JROTC we got our PT (?) shirts and talked a little bit I don’t know (and I sort of came out to my mom while in class), Algebra we did some review and I won a Gimkit (snowballs), Culinary Arts we just did a sheet with questions about our favorite candy, cakes, etc, and colored in a cupcake. Easy questions somehow. At lunch, some guys sat at my empty table, so I scoured the cafeteria for somewhere to sit, until I found a table with like two backpacks on seats. Anyway, Theater we had a sub and we had to write a report about a play, due tomorrow, but I didn’t even start it and just went on my phone. Oops? Am I going to fail a class already?</p>
    <p>By the way, happy 300th update! I just hung up that Heathers poster finally, and my sister left today. RAHHH USA USA USA...semi-hiatus over!</p>
    <p>Bye!</p>
