    <h4>8/18/23 &#45; 4:50 PM CDT &#45; Another Pep Rally</h4>
    <h1>today sucks again again again again</h1>
    <p>In JROTC we did PT stuff and got assigned our mentors. My mentor was the only one absent. In Algebra I got my test back and...I used the wrong sign. Culinary Arts we did more math and I probably failed the quiz. Theater, we did easy stage directions I already know from 7th grade and went to a pep rally. Heathers reference!!! In the pep rally they just creamed some fake mannequin (?) of the opposing team. That's really all that happened, nothing significant.</p>
    <p>ok. HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO MY FRIEND, MISCHA BACHINSKI FROM RIDE THE CYCLONE, AND CHRISTIAN SLATER (ew I hate Christian Slater)!!!</p>
    <p>bye.</p>
