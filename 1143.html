    <h1>For the record, I did not forget to update last week. I merely forgot to say that my sisters would be coming home for Thanksgiving Break and so I couldn't access my laptop. Thank you. Anyway I quite literally spent most of the day trying to finish my speech. I did finish it. And I got an A on my English essay. Haha.</h1>
