    <h4>12/20/22 &#45; 4:22 PM CST &#45; Doritos</h4>
    <h1>A Tuesday to remember? Not really, but it was good. I have to go school tomorrow, on the HALF DAY BEFORE BREAK BECAUSE IF I DIDN'T I WOULD GET A TRUANCY LETTER OR SOMETHING BECAUSE I THINK YOU CAN'T MISS 5 DAYS OF SCHOOL IN A SEMESTER OR FOR THE YEAR I FORGOT?? I've missed 4 (excused absences). At least we get to play Mario Kart and chill?</h1>
    <p>In science it was a hundred question test, that wasn't hard because we just had to search up the answers online, and they weren't even science related. ELA we had a sub instead of split list and I finally got the packet and finished it decently quick. Math was math, but not terrible. Final art day, too bad I just worked on the MC factory. RTI was RTI.</p>
    <p>At homeroom, 2 of my classmates started yelling and got in a fight, and one of them hit my teacher. I think they both got suspended.</p>
    <p>At lunch, my friend kept stealing my Doritos Dinamita chips and I immediately grabbed it from him and smacked him.</p>
    <p>School didn't even stop at the h school, just went straight home. Got home by 4-4:05 PM, new record?</p>
    <p>bye.</p>
