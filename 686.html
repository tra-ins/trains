    <h4>8/30/24 &#45; 4:51 PM CDT &#45; I Did Not Mask Today</h4>
    <h1>Today was meh.</h1>
    <p>Today I did not mask. I didn't miss the bus either. Criminal Justice we talked about police administration and the types of departments and stuff. Geometry we did a hard lockdown drill and a test. English I did nothing. Spanish we did a Gimkit and some work.</p>
    <p>bye</p>
