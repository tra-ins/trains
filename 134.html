    <h1>Today was cool and exciting.</h1>
    <p>Got Dunkin, went to the airport not that early and my mom got detained for having cough syrup. Resolved, mom met some random Iranian lady, went on the plane (had no WiFi but it was only like an hour and a half long and felt super short), got off, got a rental car, went to Glory Days (SHARK ATTACK!!!), ate hot wings, and stayed to the place my mom used to work at. Overall good day!!! Tomorrow will beâ€¦awesome!!! Unless it isn't.</p>
    <p>Also EST since I'm in VA right now (old house got sold and all, meeting friends tomorrow and Monday)</p>
    <p>Bye</p>
