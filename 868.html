    <h4>2/28/25 &#45; 4:36 PM CST &#45; The Variety Show</h4>
    <h1>Today was fine.</h1> 
    <p>In JROTC we did PT and I read after. In CJ we had a sub since my teacher was doing the SkillsUSA thing, and I left 30 minutes in to go to the variety show. It was pretty good, the first person sang From the Start by Laufey, someone else sang a Hozier song, and people sang My Shot and Dear Theodosia from Hamilton & a song from Cabaret, etc. Really fun experience. In Spanish, we learned about the present progressive tense (iendo/ando) and we did a bit more of that pyramid game. In Biology, I didn't have anything to do, so I just played a few games on my laptop and read. My teacher's trying to get rid of books from her old classroom (?), so I asked her if I could have a few and she said she'd ask.</p>
