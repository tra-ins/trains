    <h4>8/13/24 &#45; 4:53 PM CDT &#45; The First Fire Drill of the Year</h4>
    <h1>Today was okay.</h1>
    <p>Criminal Justice learned about actus reus and mens rea, and we had our first fire drill. Geometry learned line segment things. English answered questions about The Refusal. Spanish learned some months and days of the week and stuff. I was on the bus home and I was one of the last people to get on, so someone was already in my assigned seat and I was really confused. I just sat on the very back seat with someone and everyone was really mad at me.</p> 
    <p>yup bye also drum lessons in an hour</p>
