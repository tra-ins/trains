    <h4>10/4/23 &#45; 4:44 PM CDT &#45; Promotion + Emergency Alarm Test</h4>
    <h1>today was also also mid</h1>
    <p>In JROTC I got all the questions right on my drill test, AND my promotion test!!! Getting promoted soon!!!!!! In Algebra, we did midterms review. In Culinary, we went over the study guide, and right before 1:20, the emergency alarm test happened kind of, only a few people's phones went off in the room, and it wasn't even that loud. Anticlimactic much. In theater, we peer reviewed monologues and finished up them. That's all.</p>
    <p>bye bye</p>
