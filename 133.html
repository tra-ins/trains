    <h4>2/24/23 &#45; 5:35 PM CST &#45; Soccer But Not Actually Soccer</h4>
    <h1>Today was mediocre</h1>
    <p>Teachers made us stay extra long for the assembly so my English teacher could tell us all the same things she told us on the 22nd.</p>
    <p>Went to science, did questions and started a research paper.</p>
    <p>ELA was ok just did PowerPoint thing.</p>
    <p>Math was silly because I was the only person who got a 100 on the test yesterday, and that one girl asked me if I got a 100 and I nodded and she was like "of course!". I'M NOT EVEN GOOD AT MATH; I ACTUALLY FIGURED OUT ANGLES FOR ONCE BUT Y'ALL ARE JUST DENSE!!</p>
    <p>PE sucks but I just played soccer by myself (kicked a ball at a wall in the gym for 40 minutes) though wasn't really soccer, but actually kind of was since you kick balls, right?</p>
    <p>We had a sub in social studies (RTI) and the sub didn't let us on our phones so I just FINALLY COMPLETELY THAT IXL I WAS STUCK ON!!! WOOHOO!!!!!! ONLY TOOK 1 HOUR AND 24 MINUTES OF TIME AND OVER LIKE 150 QUESTIONS!! Finished at 3:10 PM CST, I have a screenshot but it's on my school laptop...</p>
    <p>My friend went to the office during science and only came back during RTI to get or put his laptop back or something. What.</p>
    <p>Not doing band by the way. Gave up on that.</p>
    <p>Hiatus starts tomorrow!!! Will be out of town for a bit to close the selling of my old house in VA, and I get to hang with my friends. I'll probably type and finish each update before coming back, so it's ready for Wednesday (March 1st). Though will probably be late unless I stay up late on Tuesday.</p>
    <p>Bye</p>
