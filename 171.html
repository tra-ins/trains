    <h1>Today was mid.</h1>
    <p>Bruh, my friends keep saying how they have Spring Break. Stop. I already had Spring Break. It is NOT Spring Break anymore!!</p>
    <p>Moving on, please stop saying states' rights, social studies teacher. I love you, however, I am tired of the Lost Causer stuff; heck, I even went through the entirety of South Carolina's secession declaration document today and found that TL;DR it cites hostility to slavery by the northern states as its cause... HMMM.. STATES' RIGHTS...TO OWN SLAVES.</p>
    <p>Anyway, in ELA we just did the final lessons, I believe, and tomorrow is the unit test. I already finished the PowerPoint, so I think I'm good, although the multiple choice might be difficult...ALSO UGH ELA TEACHER GERMANY DID START WW2; JAPAN CONTRIBUTED BUT DIDN'T...GIRL REALLY SAID JAPAN STARTED WW2...OVERSIMPLIFICATION: WW2 STARTED BECAUSE OF SEPTEMBER 1ST 1939, AKA THE INVASION OF POLAND BY THE GERMANS...</p>
    <p>Whatever, math is math; math sucks; whatever.</p>
