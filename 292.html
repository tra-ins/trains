    <h4>8/2/23 &#45; 11:17 PM CDT &#45; H School Open House</h4>
    <h1>Today was open house.</h1>
    <p>Woke up and was late to my hair appointment, got a mediocre wolfcut (should've done a pixie cut smh), went all about and stuff (got mini pineapple pizza), went home, then went to the open house. Open house kinda sucked, we were confused of where to go the whole time and kept walking around in circles. None of the teachers were in their rooms, so I didn't really get to see them. Also, my schedule sucks and for some reason I have Culinary Arts even though that wasn't one of my 4 options that I had chosen in February. Also my "friend" from last year sat uncomfortably close to my table and even mentioned HER in his conversation. Uhhh got bootleg Dunkin as well and I had even tried Starry with the mini pizza, Starry sucks and it overflowed all over the car. Went to Target and Walmart after, got some school stuff and clothes. I did see a few other classmates other than the "friend" at the open house. And 'tis all.</p>
    <p>Bye.</p>
