    <h4>12/8/22 &#45; 4:54 PM CST &#45; Trifling</h4>
    <h1>Today was fine. I really don't have much to say.</h1>
    <p>Social studies was another Teams assignment (don't worry, I got a full 90/90!), ELA was the Reading Benchmark, math was a math test I do not remember taking (he said Monday, I think he meant Thursday or Friday), art was literally art, and RTI was RTI.</p>
    <p>Ate 2 egg and cheese everything bagels from Dunkin and a Sprite, and drove to school again.</p>
    <p>Won one of the games of Uno in lunch, so.</p>
    <p>In ELA, one of the questions was about the meaning of the word "trifling" in some Sherlock Holmes excerpt. I was super torn between "obvious", "humourous", or "unimportant". I think I ended up clicking 'unimportant', and I'm super proud of myself because I think it's correct, unless Google lied.</p>
    <p>Bye.</p>
