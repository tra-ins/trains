    <h4>1/10/24 &#45; 4:31 PM CST &#45; Filial Piety</h4>
    <h1>today ehhh</h1>
    <p>In AP World, we talked about the Middle East + filial piety. In English, we read a short story. During lunch, I went to a JROTC assembly and apparently both Chief and Major are leaving. Wow. I also didn't get to finish eating my lunch, so that sucks. Then I went to Physical Science and did nothing. And then to JROTC and did nothing. I went to the bathroom after fourth period, and when I was running to the auditorium from the other half of the school, I forgot my backpack in the bathroom. So I ran all the way back. And then all the way to. At least my bus came early (early as in it was relatively early and I didn't miss it).</p>
    <p>bye...</p>
