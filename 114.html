    <h4>2/5/23 &#45; 6:32 PM CST &#45; Zaxby's</h4>
    <h1>I tried Zaxby's for the first time today.</h1>
    <p>my friend and social studies teacher overhyped it because the spicy chicken sandwich was fine. not great. why did they hype it so much. i did not miss out on anything. 7 or 7.5/10, maybe even a 6.5.</p>
