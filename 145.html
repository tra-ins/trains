    <h4>3/8/23 &#45; 6:05 PM CST &#45; PowerPoint Complete</h4>
    <h1>Today sucked.</h1>
    <p>Science- benchmark, whatever.</p>
    <p>ELA- finished chapter 6 of the PowerPoint and some of chapter 7.</p>
    <p>Lunch- slept, someone said hi.</p>
    <p>Math- the usual, dumb classmates.</p>
    <p>PE- the usual mess, that person from lunch dabbed me up, lol.</p>
    <p>Went to ELA during RTI and finished the PowerPoint!!! Or well, chapter 7 out of 11 (I think) total chapters. We had to turn in 4-7 (and 1-3 previously) so far.</p>
    <p>Yeah that's it for today.</p>
    <p>JTA Day 2.</p>
