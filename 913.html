    <h1>Today was boring.</h1> 
    <p>JROTC Chief's son came and said how great the opportunities are if you join the military or whatever. He made us do that paper tower thing again. I ate 2 sugar cookies though!! In CJ I rewatched IWTV s1e7 and finished the notes since my teacher wasn't there. No OT, so I accidentally ran down the stairs, trying to get to homeroom, and then back up when I heard. Passed the pretty girl in Bio on the way :(((((( In Spanish I turned in my worksheet from Friday and we started an essay! It's not a bad essay though, I suppose. It's about why we learn Spanish and what we liked about our teacher's class and what we learned. 800 words though. In Biology we did work. As usual.</p>
    <p>bye!</p>
