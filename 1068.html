    <h4>9/16/25 &#45; 5:35 PM CDT &#45; Yet Another Spectacular School Day</h4>
    <h1>today was good save the fact i was ill</h1> 
    <p>In English my friend and I barely read Act 4 of The Crucible. Instead we dived deep on important topics such as me rehearsing my speech and me explaining the first day of Spanish 2 incident and her telling me about her MULTIPLE past Discord boyfriends. Man, straight (?) people, amirite? And the teacher helper lady overheard too. Now in AV I too rehearsed my speech with my friend and my teacher overheard. Yeah. In Algebra we did notes and in 4th block I suffered in allergies???? no clue why i'm so ill</p>
    <p>bye</p>
