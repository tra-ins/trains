    <h4>5/16/25 &#45; 5:19 PM CDT &#45; Field Day</h4>
    <h1>Today was fine.</h1> 
    <p>In JROTC Chief put on Karate Kid 2 and I rewatched s2e4 of IWTV instead. CJ we finished our notes for the semester and I got popcorn and a Fanta from the field day area concessions stand and consumed that as I played Pokemon. In Spanish I turned in my verb spreadsheet and conversation project and read. In Biology we watched Osmosis Jones (again! although the first time wasn't in Biology).</p>
    <p>bye</p>
