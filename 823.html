    <h4>1/14/25 &#45; 4:59 PM CST &#45; Oops, I Forgot My Coat</h4>
    <h1>Today was just another day.</h1>
    <p>In JROTC I got fitted for my service dress coat. I was meant to get it after 4th period, but I forgot. CJ we did a bit of notes but ended early. Spanish I was stressed because my memory has been really bad lately, and my Spanish is very rusty. And we did nothing in Biology. I forgot my watch at home.</p>
    <p>bye</p>
