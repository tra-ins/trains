    <h4>1/29/25 &#45; 7:11 PM CST &#45; I Got My Library Card</h4>
    <h1>Today was alright.</h1>
    <p>JROTC we marched. The people in my flight outside were kind of annoying, constantly saying the f slur at one point, etc. CJ we talked about police patrolling. I feel like my CJ class never really discusses anything neutrally. We never have big discussions either. It all assumes that the police are a net positive for society. In Spanish we did more tedious Spanish work! Yaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyy............. . . . ... .. . . .. In Biology we did some enzyme and substrate stuff. And then I went to the library and got my library card right after school.</p>
    <p>bye</p>
