    <h4>5/8/24 &#45; 4:35 PM CDT &#45; There Was Another Tornado</h4>
    <h1>Today was okay.</h1>
    <p>AP World did stuff kind of forgot. English did a test. Science did a Nearpod. JROTC we went to a pep rally, and I learned what school JC is going to and also saw them. After, we went back to class and had to sit against the wall for like 40, 50, 60 around that many minutes because there was another tornado. I'm home though, my bus was one of the first to come somehow, usually it's the last. Listened to Boygenius the entire time I was cooped up against the wall. Thank you JB, PB, and LD for my life. Also Home by Now by MUNA started playing right when I arrived home, so that was silly.</p>
    <p>Bye</p>
