    <h4>2/7/23 &#45; 5:19 PM CST &#45; Hunting Coyotes</h4>
    <h1>Today kind of sucked.</h1>
    <p>There's a field trip Thursday--</p>
    <p>B day!!! Split list 'cause my science teacher isn't here--I HAD MATH. MATH!!! I ran in and out of the classroom without being noticed and got this guy who didn't want to go in and I caught; and I just sat next to one of my friend's friends because it was in a convenient location. Teacher kept talking about how people hunted the coyotes and how zebras are faster than lions, and I finished my math. I never told my friend that his friend said hi.</p>
    <p>ELA was actually cool and interesting; gallery walk like last year in US History but better and polarizing; definitely traumatized. Also when my teacher showed us a picture of the slave and free states, she named every state wrong. And I had to correct her (IE she called Maryland Massachusetts). She thanked me. Also she wrote a smiley face and replied to when I accidentally wrote my I Can statement in the wrong place, where I wrote something like "I missed a spot :(" and she wrote back something like, "it's ok :)" (I can't remember, but it was something like that). I'm ecstatic. Please draw more smiley faces and little replies.</p>
    <p>Uhh actual math was kind of the same, I guess.</p>
    <p>Art we gotta choose 5 famous paintings and combine them all. IDK but it's not that hard to choose.</p>
    <p>Extra PE was traumatic, weird run-and-back thing + got my rewards from the pyramid scheme but they forgot my 3 in 1 charger :( also some kid thought I was taking a picture of him, when I was taking a picture of the gym for snap.</p>
    <p>Traumatic day!</p>
