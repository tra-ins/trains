    <h4>10/9/24 &#45; 0:00 AM AST &#45; St. John</h4>
    <h1>We went to St. John today! It was cool to ride the taxi around the island, and the restaurant we went to was really good. The beach was cool aside from me nearly fainting a few times and being bored and alone at a picnic table because I was so sick of sand and water and all of my family was in the water. But a fine day!</h1>
