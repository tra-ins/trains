    <h4>7/10/25 &#45; 3:47 PM CDT &#45; The 1000th Update</h4>
    <h1>1000 Updates???</h1> 
    <p>jeez!!! so much has happened and not happened! all i did today was watch bridget jones's diary and an episode of house! can you imagine how many updates are like that? barely anything happened? and yet there's a thousand of them. nearly 3 years have gone by and i've been mostly consistent. jesus. except for 7/11-7/19 because i'll be tortured! i don't feel like making a seperate update for this, so i'll just update the website again once i'm back. hopefully i'll write more. i probably wont.</p>
    <p>bye</p>
