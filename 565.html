    <h4>5/1/24 &#45; 4:43 PM CDT &#45; No More Uniform Days (Until Next Year)</h4>
    <h1>Today was alright.</h1>
    <p>AP World did even more notes. English joined a group and started working with them on the project. Science did an easy worksheet. JROTC did an inspection, and finally, it was the last uniform day of the year. Plus next year, we'll be issued another uniform.</p>
    <p>Bye</p>
