    <h4>9/7/23 &#45; 4:43 PM CDT &#45; PT Test</h4>
    <h1>today boooooo</h1>
    <p>In JROTC, we did the PT test (I got 5 on the pushup, 0 on the curlup, and 12:15 on the running part) for the first time. In Algebra, we did a test. In Culinary, we did another study guide, and in theater, we did some exercises or something. Yeah, not much. Though I did see this guy (specifically the hypocrite one) from last year gossip about me and the magnet school or something as I walked over to my bus.</p>
    <p>yeah bye whtver</p>
