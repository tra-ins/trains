    <h4>10/26/23 &#45; 4:43 PM CDT &#45; Death of a Salesman</h4>
    <h1>today was ok</h1>
    <p>In JROTC, we started our projects (I'm doing the B-18). In Algebra, we did another Gimkit (and my team won against the zombies). In Culinary, we made playdough (and ermm mine kinda sucks). In theater, I turned my project in and read the entirety of Death of a Salesman (I LOVE DEATH OF A SALESMAN I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE IT SO MUCH ONG).</p>
    <p>bye</p>
