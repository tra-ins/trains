    <h4>4/3/24 &#45; 4:59 PM CDT &#45; I Have an F in AP World</h4>
    <h1>Today was eh.</h1>
    <p>AP World did notes. English presented. Science did stations. JROTC did inspection and practiced drill. I got told by this one guy that if we were to do a bearings test, I'd be the first one to crack. And I see that. Also I have an F in AP World?</p>
    <p>yeah bye</p>
