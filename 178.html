    <h4>4/10/23 &#45; 4:52 PM CDT &#45; Ohhhh...I Was Right! My Crush is Dating That Guy...</h4>
    <h1>Today was okay, I guess.</h1>
    <p>Social studies, got 100 on an assignment, did a map, the usual. We get to finish all of the units (except state civics or something) upon the final notes on Thursday or Wednesday, I forgot. Grr Reconstruction!!!</p>
    <p>Uhhh ELA we just did Space Race because we have STATE TESTING next week, so no Holocaust until after. Uhh also my teacher was spouting inaccurate stuff, and saying how Communists are like the Taliban. Yes, I'm serious. She called Communists terrorists, LOL.</p>
    <p>Answered 2 questions in math, haha!!!</p>
    <p>We had to make a superhero in theater, and I made Office Worker Guy!!! Teacher liked it.</p>
    <p>Uhh extra PE, the usual + PE guy asked me about my grades, I said 'I don't know'. Someone [not my crush] accidentally hit me with a volleyball and my crush said my name!!!! But I also learned that my crush IS dating that guy and has been for 2 months. Great...</p>
    <p>JTA Day 35; god only knows if it can continue due to the acceptance letter</p>
    <p>uh bye</p>
