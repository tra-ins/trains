    <h1>Today also sucks.</h1>
    <p>While on the bleachers waiting to be called to go to class, I heard people literally RIGHT BEHIND ME talking about me. They were asking each other who I was and describing my appearance or something. I'm right there bestie.</p>
    <p>Social studies- just watched the mediocre 'America: The Story of Us" series (one of the episodes about westward expansion, specifically the one with the Donners). I've seen a couple of the episodes before in previous classes, but I'm still questioning why they have such peculiar choices as speakers. Whatever, I shouldn't dwell on that question much. Anyway, I missed #10 on the worksheet while watching because literally nobody heard what the narrator said and the teacher didn't rewind back...and all I heard was people saying it was 'trails' or 'generations'. I put 'trails'. My friend told me later that it was 'generations'. Someone even asked me what it was and I said I didn't know.</p>
    <p>In science we had to write a 4 page paper about fossil fuels--oil; natural gas; and coal. I only finished 2 and a half pages because we didn't have enough time (it's a C day) and what I've wrote so far was about oil...and since the teacher never reads what we write, I wrote jokes about coups and the US and stuff, and ranted about capitalism, how much I hated oil and pollution, etc.</p>
    <p>ELA was cool as always; just the usual stuff.</p>
    <p>At lunch, my friend also told me not to go to the magnet school (I told him about my family forcing me to apply), and I ended up hitting him a couple times with my lunchbox for actual valid justified reasons, because look, I haven't done it in like 1/2 months and he made me do this (he kept poking me on the head and stuff, and touched my vest when I said not to a couple times. Also he complimented my vest when I mentioned not to touch it or spill anything on it).</p>
    <p>Math was math; got 100 on the functions test (told ya it was easy) and ykw asked me for my paper to copy off or look at for the last question of the test and I just let them because hey, why not? They got a 75 by the way (caught a glimpse of their paper by accident).</p>
    <p>PE wasn't as miserable, teacher just made me and a classmate help him pick up leaves (I held the bag with the classmate) for like 20 minutes, and then I spent the rest of the class staring at mysterious flying bugs in the same spot I usually go to. Also that annoying girl was the 2nd and final person to compliment my beautiful white fancy patterned vest with a black shirt and black pants.</p>
    <p>The teacher made us do IXL during RTI for 20 minutes. Pain. I just wanted to go on my switch and play Tetris!!! :(</p>
    <p>Bye</p>
