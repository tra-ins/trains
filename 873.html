    <h4>3/5/25 &#45; 4:48 PM CST &#45; I Now Know What "Sensible Shoes" Means.</h4>
    <h1>Today was fine.</h1> 
    <p>In JROTC we marched. In CJ we did notes and I went to the small theater during OT and learned that that golfing trip thing for doing well on the EOCs/ACTs is on May 2nd. Okay. In Spanish we did our chapter 1 test, I did well, and we worked on our project. My friend told me that "sensible shoes" means a woman/someone who is a lesbian. I am neither a woman nor a lesbian. Bro. In Biology we did notes.</p>
    <p>bye</p>
