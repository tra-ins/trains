    <h4>11/10/22 &#45; 8:34 PM CST &#45; Donut</h4>
    <h1>Thursdays are the greatest days.</h1>
    <p>Today was good!!!!!!! Was very smiley :))))))))))))))))</p>
    <p>Social studies, had a unit test but had to leave right at the beginning for more testing (WE'RE FINALLY DONE WOOHOO!)</p>
    <p>ELA finished the testing because the lady had a meeting (very quick, so quick that it took like half an hour long). ELA okay.</p>
    <p>Math we barely did math. Donuts for the teams and people winning (we all got 2 except the boys that don't play any significant sports, or any at all). Also now that guy has to hold my backpack for an extra day! (Monday)</p>
    <p>Art was cool, finished my card.</p>
    <p>In RTI I did the test and got a 145/150 (ONE WRONG). It was easy, missed one because I didn't pay attention in one of the readings (I never saw it, but okay). Not mad!!! Also [YK WHO. HOODIE INDIVIDUAL] said something that sounded very ominous about a test when I gave her my laptop, I didn't understand what she said because it was loud and she talked too fast [omg N-] [not N speed] [fairly quick though]. She saw my teacher pull up my grade as well, might be jealous, I don't know, this is purely speculation (she's actually smart I don't know why she'd be jealous anyway). Too bad I like the subject!!! :)))))</p>
    <p>Bye,</p>
