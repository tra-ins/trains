    <h1>hohohoho i played peace walker and then i played holdfast naval! as usual for a thursday!</h1> 
    <p>i had a really scary nightmare about like... a single from mitski's upcoming album being a torture kinda thing and when i woke up my heart was racing and i heard a dog bark that seemed nearby and i tried not to think of the dream because i thought that thinking about it would make it happen again. maybe thats a sign. but i kinda wanna know whar the song was</p>
