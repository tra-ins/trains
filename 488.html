    <h4>2/14/24 &#45; 4:56 PM CST &#45; It is Valentine's Day</h4>
    <h1>Today sucks as well.</h1>
    <p>AP World I flunked a DBQ thing. English did puzzle packet. Physical Science did a whodunnit thing (not Cribb smh). JROTC we did an inspection and SOMEONE chose me to lead the 30 step drill sequence in front of a group. Luckily I didn't have to move, and I somehow remembered most of it. Also have a sad Valentine's Day I'm jealous.</p>
    <p>bye</p>
