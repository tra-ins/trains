    <h4>3/7/25 &#45; 4:50 PM CST &#45; K9s</h4>
    <h1>Today was ok I guess.</h1> 
    <p>In JROTC we did PT. In CJ we did more notes about the use of force and we watched a gruesome video of K9s commanded by officers attacking people. Great. In Spanish we got donuts!! Yum!!! And did a workbook page. In Biology we did a test and I got a 96???? My teacher said that she can't give any of her old books to me though :(</p>
    <p>bye</p>
