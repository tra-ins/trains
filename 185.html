    <h4>4/17/23 &#45; 4:44 PM CDT &#45; TCAP Day 1</h4>
    <h1>First day of the TCAPs; AN ESSAY ABOUT IF PEOPLE SHOULD DRINK MORE WATER (ELA SUBPART 1). Also not happy Monday.</h1>
    <p>Social studies- TCAPs (they made us watch Zootopia after) until lunch, after went to ELA for 15 minutes, then math.</p>
    <p>After math was over, we went to theater, where some kid went in my personal space and stared at my phone, and then I think the same kid sprayed nasty perfume on me. What did I do to deserve that.</p>
    <p>Extra PE was the usual thing.</p>
    <p>JTA Day 41; MY MATH TEACHER TOLD ME TO SIGN THE ACCEPTANCE LETTER!! NO!!!</p>
    <p>bye</p>
