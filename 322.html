    <h4>9/1/23 &#45; 5:11 PM CDT &#45; Heathers Day</h4>
    <h1>today wasn't very interesting as well, but happy Heathers Day! September 1st, 1989. Dear diary.</h1>
    <p>In JROTC I got my shoes, and we jogged and stuff. In Algebra we did slope again. In Culinary, we took the safety test. I guessed for every question, and while doing it, I noticed that the word bank had a pattern of the order of the answers, so ermmm in my inferencing era. My lab partner looked over my test, said that I was okay (ermmm I'm kind of ermmm epic because I somehow got everything right I think idk the tests haven't been graded yet, all just guessing and noticing the word bank being silly). And then my partner gave me her notes, so I ermmmm am not failing anymore. In theater, my group didn't present because my partner wasn't there.</p>
