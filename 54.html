    <h4>12/7/22 &#45; 4:44 PM CST &#45; Hour of Code</h4>
    <h1>Today was pretty good, nothing much to say.</h1>
    <p>Social studies was Hour of Code (I did some music game), science was notes, ELA was Amplify, math was math, art was also Hour of Code, RTI was RTI (and Hour of Code).</p>
    <p>I really can't think of anything about today, today was decent. I ate 2 egg and cheese everything bagels from Dunkin and an apple juice (rancid, very rancid) and drove to school.</p>
    <p>Bye</p>
