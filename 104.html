    <h1>Ahhh today was fine.</h1>
    <p>Social studies test = easy A. The only one I'm 99% sure I got wrong was a question I knew was bad and was fixed (yay 200 technically). Most of the questions were on the Kahoot, so I didn't need to study last night/12 in the morning. Also I literally speedran the test and played some Tetris and finished building some apartments on the old MC factory world.</p>
    <p>ELA was fine, may or may not have just failed a solo but we'll see ;( (also I finished memorizing the Prologue last night, so I'm preparing for tomorrow). At least we're going to act out the Death Scene tomorrow, I think.</p>
    <p>Math was math. That's all.</p>
    <p>Art we just watched a video about the Mona Lisa getting stolen on August 21st 1911. Already knew about it. Slayed an intruder drill, though.</p>
    <p>RTI was RTI.</p>
    <p>also a few days ago or yesterday there was like a shooting threat towards my school, but it was the wrong school with the same acronym as mine, lol? should i lol at this info?</p>
    <p>bye...</p>
