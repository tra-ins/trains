    <h4>5/23/23 &#45; 8:57 PM CDT &#45; Graduation Day/Aubrey</h4>
    <h1>Today was okay and technically the last day of school (still like a day or two after but you don't need to go).</h1>
    <p>Happy birthday to Aubrey from the hit game OMORI. Slay I guess.</p>
    <p>Uhh science watched Puss in Boots.</p>
    <p>ELA, got a personalized message from the teacher (we all did) and negotiated the 200 stockpiled bucks I have. I spent 30 for one Sprite and she said she'd give me a pack of Sprite. Still waiting.</p>
    <p>Math just grinded flag games and stuff, listened to music.</p>
    <p>Theater in the band room because all the related arts were there. Uhh still listened to music.</p>
    <p>Same in RTI, but there was almost nobody there by the end of the day. I kept seeing people crying and hugging each other during dismissal.</p>
    <p>Wore my suit and went to graduation but didn't know where to go in the building. Luckily, I made it and immediately saw kids from my class and had to stand by them. Got a few compliments by them and a few teachers though.</p>
    <p>We sat down and I just clapped for everyone that isn't magnet, until I got up and went to the stage. Uhh ummm yeah uhh went to McDonald's after.</p>
    <p>umm yep idk if im going tomorrow but this kid from the magnet got in a car crash a few nights ago, was in a coma, and...died. rest in peace g, fly high. i didnt know him but i feel rly bad for him :(; also im sorry for slightly giggling bc i thought the beta girl was crying about graduating and not that poor kid. i am so sorry.</p>
    <p>Bye</p>
