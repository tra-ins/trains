    <h1>Just another Wednesday...</h1>
    <p>With drugs you'll lose, say NO and refuse!</p>
    <p>Ok, ok, well that's the slogan I did for this poster we all had to make for some contest or whatever.</p>
    <p>ART CLASS SUCKS I HATE ART!!!!</p>
    <p>Also, I keep confusing myself in English class with my awful answers loool.</p>
    <p>Oh yeah, I did a math test today!!!! It was easy I hope I got a hundred!!!! I swear if I somehow messed up I would-- Jk, I'd still be proud, even if it was a B since it's math and I'm terrible at that subject!!!!</p>
