    <h4>4/11/23 &#45; 6:44 PM CDT &#45; Racist</h4>
    <h1>Today was mid.</h1>
    <p>In homeroom, my classmates were saying how they keep weapons (GUNS) for self defense...I love the 2nd Amendment!</p>
    <p>During science, these guys were talking trash about me. Called me racist??? "She never talks to anyone", yeah because I don't like anyone and everyone ignores me whenever I got something to say. Same dude who got mad at me for excusing myself.</p>
    <p>Uhhh ELA Space Race.</p>
    <p>Uhhhh math just math. Surface area.</p>
    <p>Theater superhero again! Yay I get to write my own script ALONE. Also all of my classmates were saying very racist things about Asian people, while wearing a rice hat...</p>
    <p>Umm extra PE the usual.</p>
    <p>Beta meeting...agenda, we did that kind of competition where you have to create a free-standing tower with just one piece of paper (gifted prog flashbacks, both that time and this time failed miserably). After the meeting ended, my mom was very late because my mom didn't know about the meeting...oops...lady told me to "do better". Yummy McDonald's.</p>
    <p>JTA Day 36; god only knows if it can continue due to the acceptance letter</p>
    <p>bye</p>
