    <h4>4/17/24 &#45; 4:48 PM CDT &#45; English EOC Part 3</h4>
    <h1>Today was eh.</h1>
    <p>Finished English EOCs. Read more of The Outsiders. Finished timeline for science. And did notes in 4th block for AP World, fortunately not having to go to JROTC and do an inspection. That's all.</p>
    <p>bye</p>
