    <h4>2/22/24 &#45; 4:45 PM CST &#45; Color Pencils</h4>
    <h1>Today was eh.</h1>
    <p>AP World did an assignment, and I'm making my mom buy me color pencils just to complete one assignment for this class. English finished part one of The Odyssey and did schedule. Science did assignment. JROTC saw JC in the hallway because we had to cheer on our wrestling team, and talked about space or something.</p>
    <p>bye.</p>
