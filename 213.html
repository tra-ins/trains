    <h4>5/15/23 &#45; 4:41 PM CDT &#45; Ramen & Newsies</h4>
    <h1>Today was okay.</h1>
    <p>Uhhh nothing happened in social studies, ELA we just watched a Holocaust documentary with questions.</p>
    <p>In math, the teacher made the boys do work in the textbook and he just let us have ramen and on our phones. Oh, we also signed our names on a 'graffiti wall' as the last class. I just wrote my name, a smiley face, and a checkmark next to 'boys suck'. No hate, actually all the hate, boys.</p>
    <p>Uhh in theater, the teacher made us watch Newsies (the musical). I hate Newsies with a passion.</p>
    <p>In extra pe, we had the choice of basketball, volleyball, or soccer, and a couple of us just sat in the bleachers and refused to play. The teachers tried getting us to play but we persisted, and I think they just gave up.</p>
    <p>Bye bye</p>
