    <h4>3/13/23 &#45; 5:50 PM CDT &#45; The Beta Pictures Ft. Crushing & Yearbook Confusion</h4>
    <h1>Today was also fine.</h1>
    <p>Social studies was fine, just did some notes, got the first question wrong because I only clicked 'yes' instead of 'yes', 'no', and 'maybe', but the teacher corrected it so I still have 101% in that class, LOL.</p>
    <p>ELA uhh crush apologized for bumping into pencil!!! Uhhhhhh ANYWAYS, I left for Beta club pictures during class. I didn't know there were Beta pictures so I didn't wear my Beta suit, but at least I wore a nice and fancy orange blouse I got yesterday from Goodwill. I wandered so much and almost skipped the pictures while waiting, but didn't and instead got it over with (sitting on the bleachers with my grade) and went back.</p>
    <p>Before lunch, my ELA teacher complimented the blouse and asked how the Beta pictures went, and I rambled about how I would've wore a suit if I knew about it beforehand and she immediately stopped listening. Thanks for being a great listener, []. At lunch, my "friend" threw a carrot at me, so I threw it back (but missed and almost hit someone sitting next to my crush), I was going to throw it again but he threw it at that guy who was sitting there and the guy came and beat him to death, so I used the time to throw this apple I was handed by some guys I was sitting near at him. Destroyed. KYS.</p>
    <p>After lunch and the bit of ELA left, I went to math and it was math. That's it. It was math. Virtual drill, I guess. I don't know. Translations, etc are easy.</p>
    <p>PE we didn't do anything because they were setting up the STEAM fair, hahahahaha.</p>
    <p>No extra PE because of the STEAM fair, so we went to RTI and I finally asked my teacher about the Yearbook and she said to go to this one classroom (that I don't know where it could be) and that you can purchase it on the website. I couldn't find it on the website. I'm sobbing. Please end my misery. Anyway, while doing IXL, I overheard (sorry) my crush say that she's bi (and that she was more into women? idk about that part). WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW I still have no shot because I'm shy and not even acquaintanced with them. Ughhhhhhhhh I'm hopelessssssssssssssssss kmssssssssssss</p>
    <p>Bye.</p>
