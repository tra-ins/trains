    <h4>8/15/24 &#45; 4:41 PM CDT &#45; Nothing Really Happened</h4>
    <h1>Today was fine.</h1>
    <p>Criminal Justice we did a Kahoot. Geometry we learned about angles. English we read another short story. Spanish we did a Gimkit and we learned greetings and stuff. Forgot to mention: 1. The person behind the lunch line counter called me sir!!!! 2. I talked to the Algebra teacher helper lady again today (she came up to me during lunch). 3. People were bothering me in English class????? We're high schoolers. Come on. We're not even freshmen. Okay that's all I have.</p>
