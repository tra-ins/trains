    <h4>5/1/25 &#45; 5:09 PM CDT &#45; May Day</h4>
    <h1>Today was ok.</h1> 
    <p>JROTC got made fun of for bringing The Iliad outside to watch the others do their PT tests. CJ got back from applying for DE at the other school and did notes about hate crimes. Spanish did new workbook work. Biology watched The Lorax (2012). Yes, that Lorax.</p>
