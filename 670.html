    <h4>8/14/24 &#45; 4:54 PM CDT &#45; Unzipped Fly</h4>
    <h1>Today was also okay.</h1>
    <p>Criminal Justice I realized I left my fly unzipped. Oopsies! And we learned about the criminal justice process. Geometry we learned about things I learned in middle school. English I finished the assignment from yesterday and read the poem we had to read. Spanish we made Duolingo accounts and Gimkit accounts. Feliz miercoles!</p>
