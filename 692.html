    <h4>9/5/24 &#45; 4:55 PM CDT &#45; An Argumentative Essay Among Other Things</h4>
    <h1>Today was meh.</h1>
    <p>In Criminal Justice we talked about arrest warrants and traffic stops. In Geometry we talked about translations. In English we started the argumentative essay (I mean, I didn't start it but we were supposed to) and did a Mastery Connect thing. And in Spanish, we learned more about verb conjugation and did a Gimkit.</p>
    <p>yeah bye.</p>
