    <h4>3/25/24 &#45; 4:57 PM CDT &#45; What?</h4>
    <h1>Today was ehh...? What even happened?</h1>
    <p>In AP World we did notes, and one of my classmates kept arguing with my teacher about the Founding Fathers, and they ended up talking about the Roosevelts, and my teacher called Eleanor Roosevelt the D slur?? Like the lesbian one. I get she was in that relationship with the reporter or activist iirc but sob... In English we did a webquest, because we're starting The Outsiders??? I DID THE OUTSIDERS IN MIDDLE SCHOOL. FOR REFERENCE, I AM IN HIGH SCHOOL. ARE YOU KIDDING ME I STILL HAVE MY OLD COPY OF THE BOOK TOO. Physical Science my group started over and made our rollercoaster in 40 minutes?? And it works?? Also some girl in my group kept interrogating me, asking me why I got my haircut. Why did people swarm me about a mere haircut. In JROTC we learned about Mars.</p>
