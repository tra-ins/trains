    <h4>5/20/24 &#45; 4:53 PM CDT &#45; Last Week</h4>
    <h1>Today was mediocre. Last week of the school year I guess.</h1>
    <p>AP World had our end of semester party (I did not participate). English the class performed scenes from Romeo and Juliet. Science we were turning in out projects, of which I never printed out the 2nd part and did not even begin the 1st part. JROTC studied for the final exam.</p> 
    <p>Apologies for a lack of lengthy updates, my life's just kind of depressing and lacking in interest. Would someone who finds this when I die find paragraphs about Ace Attorney interesting? Would one find me obsessing over Goulstrade for a year interesting, or me slowly devolving with my transmasc hcs for a specific character? I mean, it's actually almost exactly one year since I first finished TGAAC and started being into Goulstrade. How fun. I could also ramble about the gender/sexuality stuff that's been going on. Ooh I'm transmasc and nonbinary and butch and I'm pre-T and unsatisfied with my life oooohhhhhhhhh. Okay I'm sorry. I always question why no matter what one who attempts to be masculine in a truly masculine way does, one is always considered feminine or "female" at the heart. Why? Why can't I just have my masculinity not in question? Why do I have to resort to tolling hypermasculinity to attempt to dissuade such? Okay yeah I wish I was a cis man okay goodbye</p>
    <p>bye</p>
