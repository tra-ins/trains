    <h4>8/30/23 &#45; 6:16 PM CDT &#45; Tasting (ft. First Missed Bus and Varsity Jacket)</h4>
    <h1>today was a little interesting. you have to squint to find the interesting aspects.</h1>
    <p>In JROTC we did something and then we practiced the 15 count manual of arms (I have no idea how to do it, I have never held one of the replica rifles) and then something with sabres (YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS I LOVE LVOE LOVE LOVE LOVE SABRESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS). In Algebra, we did slope. Again. WHY DO WE ALWAYS REVIEW SLOPE IN MATH LIKE BRO I'VE DONE THIS SINCE LIKE 7TH GRADE; SLOPE IS SO EASY.</p>
    <p>In Culinary, we tasted our cookie dough bites, and I rated them a 7.5/10. It tasted mostly like sugar (we put half a cup of sugar and half a cup of brown sugar, and Chef had told us that we wouldn't need to add the SALT), but it was very good. Uhh in theater we did some pantomime project thing again, but in the hallway to, I saw some guy wearing a shirt that said that "there are only two genders". Isn't that against the dress code? Also respectfully not respectfully if that crusty guy sees this, please never set foot in this high school again.</p>
    <p>I missed the bus (waited for an hour and a half). Also my varsity jacket came YAYYYYYYYYYYYY FINALLY I HAVE A VARSITY JACKET I'M GOING TO CRY I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE THEM SO MUCHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE (I haven't played a sport since fall of 2020 I think)!!!!!!</p>
    <p>Bye</p>
