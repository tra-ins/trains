    <h4>10/21/24 &#45; 4:52 PM CDT &#45; I Got My Picture Taken</h4>
    <h1>Instead of doing anything for Criminal Justice, we went to the gym and got our pictures taken. And then we sat in the classroom until 3rd block, when we had to go to homeroom to get our report cards (all As except a B in English) for the first quarter, and then go to 3rd block. I read TQOTD for the entirety of the wait until 3rd block. In English we started our essay introductions. In Spanish we did workbook work and a Gimkit and a quiz.</h1>
