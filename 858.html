    <h4>2/18/25 &#45; 5:01 PM CST &#45; Snowing Tomorrow</h4>
    <h1>Today was fine.</h1> 
    <p>In JROTC we learned about the new virtual bathroom passes. Great. Somehow I got only one question wrong on the Marksmanship Safety Quiz. Great? In CJ we couldn't do anything because half of the class wasn't here. I just read. In Spanish we got our chapter 1 vocab sheets and did some stuff with our verb spreadsheets and it was pretty fun. I love Spanish. In Biology we did more work. No school tomorrow since it's snowing, yay!</p>
    <p>bye also happy birthday to basil from omori</p>
