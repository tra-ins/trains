    <h4>11/11/22 &#45; 10:15 PM CST &#45; Remembrance</h4>
    <h1>Boring Friday</h1>
    <p>Today was okay, I guess it was Veterans' Day (WE STILL HAD SCHOOL GRRR) and there was an assembly during math (near the end, though) and the beginning of art.</p>
    <p>Science booklet, ELA finished Frankenstein (also uhh umm please no gifted program ok thanks mama), math was math, art was decent (we drew pets from these pictures provided to us and I chose a demonic chihuhua), RTI was RTI.</p>
    <p>Not really anything else to mention!</p>
    <p>WW1, Armistace/Remebrance Day was today. Cool I guess.</p>
    <p>Bye :)</p>
