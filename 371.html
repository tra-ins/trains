    <h4>10/20/23 &#45; 4:52 PM CDT &#45; Captain on Deck</h4>
    <h1>today was also also mid</h1>
    <p>In JROTC we did warm ups, and then we played Captain on Deck, in which I did pretty meh until the last round, which I was the 6th to last person left. I also got to interact with my crush a little bit and touch her arm, so that was pretty cool. Then I just walked laps around in the grass. In Algebra, we did more stuff. In Culinary, my group already finished so we did nothing. And in theater, we did this group thingy, but my group hasn't performed yet.</p>
    <p>bye</p>
