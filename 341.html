    <h1>today was a day but yay my mom thought ride the cyclone was "interesting"...her fav was mischa (omg like me) and her favorite song was talia (my 2nd fav!!)</h1>
    <p>In JROTC we practiced the 30 step drill sequence, and I saw a yellow plane. So exciting. In Algebra, we did functions. In Culinary, we did another packet, or something. And in theater, we're doing a 30 second monologue please help me I haven't finished the worksheet nor do I know what I'm going to do and we're performing it tomorrow.</p>
    <p>Bye.</p>
