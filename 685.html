    <h4>8/29/24 &#45; 4:35 PM CDT &#45; Wow! I Finished the Scorpion and I Started Masking Again!</h4>
    <h1>Today was eh.</h1>
    <p>Today I began to mask again. I am not getting sick with COVID (still a threat) nor monkeypox or any other disease. Also it's just generally something we should do, masking that is. Anyway, made a timeline of policing in Criminal Justice class (we talked about the MET...heh.....), and did a review in Geometry (it was easy, as usual). In English, we did some group thing that I never turned in. Oops. And we did a quiz, that I also never turned in, because there was a vocab section the teacher never mentioned and I never finished it. In Spanish class, we did a Gimkit, a quiz (10/10), and more textbook work. We are still formulating basic sentences. I also finished reading The Scorpion!!! I'm currently reading The Outcast now.</p>
    <p>that's all bye</p>
