    <h1>today was eh</h1>
    <p>In JROTC, we finished watching Remember the Titans, and our final or whatever exam is going to be about it, I'm screwed. In Algebra, I forgot my laptop at home, so I didn't do anything In Culinary, we made our own chicken salads (and mine was actually good). And in theater, we worked on our projects until the pep rally, and I realized that I have to type my play script out.</p>
    <p>Bye</p>
