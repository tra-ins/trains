    <h4>1/18/23 &#45; 5:10 PM CST &#45; Slope Formula</h4>
    <h1>Today was traumatic, but not that bad...?</h1>
    <p>AHHHHH I GOT A 100 ON MY SCIENCE PROJECT BUT WE'RE STARTING ANOTHER ONE ABOUT CONSTELLATIONS ON FRIDAY HELPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP</p>
    <p>ELA we did more Romeo & Juliet, sad I wasn't chosen by sticks to act :(</p>
    <p>Uhhh I keep winning Uno at lunch ahhahahahahhahahahahah</p>
    <p>Math. Math. MATH. Ok well first, I walked behind ykw unless you don't ykw which is good because I forgot about them until my friend mentioned them when trying to blackmail (?) me sort of into admitting who stole the Uno cards. One of his friends did, and I knew, and his friend had put it under my lunch box while he wasn't looking. ANYWAYS, my teacher asked us the formula for slope. This one guy missed it a few times (he said like rise over run and the SLOPE INTERCEPT FORMULA), and I was like "y2-y1-" and I actually got it. BUT EVERYONE WAS SAYING THAT THEY DIDN'T LEARN IT, AND I WAS CONFUSED AND BEING INTERROGATED BY THE TEACHER ASKING IF I LEARNED IT. IT'S JUST THE FORMULA FOR SLOPE??? M = Y2-Y1/X2-X1??? Anyway, hyperventilated a little and was extremely stressed out that math period. I shouldn't have been so indecisive, "uhh idk" and "ixl???" and "uhhh ok sure". Note to self: This is why I never answer questions, because every time I do I get embarrassed.</p>
    <p>Uhhh art was fine (didn't go to PE!!!), drew McDonald's (OMORI meal). RTI was RTI but I almost threw my Switch in agony and my teacher was questioning why we [I] was let out so early. Does she know? She knows. Or does she? Love art. Live for art.</p>
    <p>bye</p>
