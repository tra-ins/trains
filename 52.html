    <h4>12/5/22 &#45; 4:36 PM CST &#45; Cough</h4>
    <h1>I think the Benchmark is tomorrow or later this week, I don't know. Anyway, I've been coughing a lot (because I've been sick) and today, I just kept COUGHING during class. Truly the cough of all time. Decent day.</h1>
    <p>Social studies notes, ELA Romeo and Juliet, math was math, art was cool, and RTI was RTI (apparently this one girl who's pretty funny and loud moved schools, but nobody really knows the details so oh well. And no extra PE because of some high school tests, I don't know).</p>
    <p>I tripped and fell on my knee on the concrete on the way to ELA when I realized that it's raining and I probably shouldn't be holding my laptop outside.</p>
    <p>Nobody remembered I was absent Thursday, but they did remember I was absent Friday. Didn't really miss anything, but there're probably more stories from today that I can't remember.</p>
    <p>Bye</p>
