    <h4>1/1/23 &#45; 6:43 PM CDT &#45; 2022: A Year in Review</h4>
    <h1>2022 was a mediocre year, for sure. I really didn't enjoy it, but there were a few high points which are overshadowed by the lowest points. It's like a repeat of 2020/2021.</h1>
    <p>Obviously the best parts of 2022 were more N in PKMEX, the last day of school before Winter Break, playing OMORI near the very end of the year, the times I actually got to play with friends, and this website. I made some robux off of a game I made in 2021 that sucks and is purely a joke, which is weird. Probably missing a few things. All my teachers at this school are cool as well, hope none of them hate me by the time I come back.</p>
    <p>Worst parts were mostly when I moved (happened before this website was ever conceptualized) and just most of the year as a whole was very boring and lackluster.</p>
    <p>I don't want to explain my entire 2022, but I'll just end off with a farewell to 2022 and a lack of hope for 2023.</p>
