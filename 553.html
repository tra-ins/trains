    <h4>4/19/24 &#45; 4:50 PM CDT &#45; A D in AP World, Again</h4>
    <h1>Today was meh.</h1>
    <p>AP World turned in the brochure due weeks ago, grade raised to a D from an F. English read more of The Outsiders (Johnny dies in the next chapter IIRC). Science watched Honey, I Shrunk the Kids. JROTC finished another assignment due weeks ago for AP World (definitely done poorly).</p>
