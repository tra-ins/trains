    <h4>2/27/24 &#45; 4:44 PM CST &#45; Burrito</h4>
    <h1>Today was eh.</h1>
    <p>AP World did more notes. English finished The Odyssey. Science did a bottle rocket experiment. JROTC finished the last 10 mins ofInterstellar and talked about college. Don't have much to say except that I had one of the saddest breakfast burritos in my entire life as school breakfast.</p>
    <p>bye</p>
