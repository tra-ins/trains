    <h4>4/30/24 &#45; 4:48 PM CDT &#45; Maybe I Should Have Said Something</h4>
    <h1>Today was mediocre.</h1>
    <p>AP World did more notes. English started some project, but maybe I should've said something because I didn't actually do anything nor join a group, all I did was do crosswords. Science did Nearpods. JROTC did the 30 step drill sequence, and I forgot to salute and turn to the right when doing Eyes Right, and I turned to the left when I said Left Face, instead of turning to the right. Yeah.</p>
    <p>Bye</p>
