    <h4>3/6/25 &#45; 4:53 PM CST &#45; I Shot an Air Rifle Again, in a Kneeling Position</h4>
    <h1>Today was ok.</h1> 
    <p>In JROTC I shot an air rifle once more but in a kneeling position as the title says. I think I did worse than I did standing. It was very uncomfortable. I want to do it again. In CJ we did notes. In Spanish we started our Chapter 2 vocab and we had a lot of fun. In Biology we did notes.</p>
