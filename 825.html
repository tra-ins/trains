    <h4>1/16/25 &#45; 5:01 PM CST &#45; El Carro</h4>
    <h1>Today was meh.</h1>
    <p>In JROTC we practiced marching again. In CJ we learned about communication again. In Spanish, we did a charades/hedbanz-esque game but with spanish phrases, and then we did a game with pressing the buzzer and saying the right verb conjugation. Thank goodness I understand how to conjugate the verb 'comer'. My side of the room lost though. It was a riveting experience. In Biology, I wasn't paying attention and I began to do a Spanish project involving my creations, the nefarious El Carro and the magnanimous El Bus. Yep.</p>
