    <h4>5/5/25 &#45; 6:11 PM CDT &#45; I GOT A NEW TV!!!</h4>
    <h1>Today was OK.</h1> 
    <p>In JROTC I missed a few minutes since I went to Guidance to turn my advanced form in, and when I got back, the army recruiters made us do charades + exercises, and they called me "fancy shirt" and made me reenact "rearranging a room". My team lost, though someone did guess my reenactment. In CJ we did notes about sexual harrassment, and before getting to class I got my yearbook. In Spanish I did work and got my teacher to sign my yearbook. In Biology my teacher put on the second half of The Lion King (even though we finished it already), signed my yearbook, and told us about a project. Mine is about energy flow in the savanna. On the way to the auditorium I got my Geometry teacher from last semester to sign my yearbook and told her about the unexcused absence from December. It will be fixed soon. And I set up my TV when I got home!! That's why this update is an hour later than usual.</p>
    <p>bye</p>
