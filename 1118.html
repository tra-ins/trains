    <h1>today was... meh</h1> 
    <p>In English we read ch. 5 of tgg and a fire happened! Supposedly a fire happened. In AV we didnt continue the fellowship of the ring :/ did a storyboard assignment of a child of yet another argument. Algebra did notes. New school lunch that's allegedly better!? I will try tomorrow and friday to confirm. In speech I... admittedly... did not remember that... you have to do all 3 speeches in order to pass the class and i... anyway i drove by myself and did quite poorly! but i made it home safely.</p>
