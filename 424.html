    <h1>today was ok</h1>
    <p>In JROTC we watched Remember the Titans (oh boy). In Algebra, we did a statistics project. In Culinary, we made some jello thing, I don't know, but we didn't make anything completely yesterday, thank goodness. And in theater, we continued the project (scenic design aspect though).</p>
    <p>Bye</p>
