    <h4>8/29/23 &#45; 6:00 PM CDT &#45; Cook</h4>
    <h1>today was somewhat interesting</h1>
    <p>In JROTC, we went over uniforms and stuff. In Algebra, we talked about slope. Literally middle school level math. In Culinary, we made the cookie dough bites and my partner was actually really nice. I was talking to her and I called the class our family. I don't know why. I don't know what came over me. Anyway, we'll get to taste the bites tomorrow.</p>
    <p>During theater, I left early and went to an eye appointment, like 2 months post-surgery. My eye is fine. I got Buffalo Wild Wings yay.</p>
    <p>bye</p>
