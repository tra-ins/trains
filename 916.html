    <h1>Today was ehh.</h1> 
    <p>Had 2nd block (CJ) first and watched 2 episodes of IWTV. Then went to 1st block (JROTC), all the way back down the stairs to the other side of the building, and did PT and someone came up to me and had a small conversation and told me I looked old for my age. I was confused until I looked in the mirror for the first time in a while and yeah, I could see it but I still look like an 11 year old boy if I ever do so called "pass". Spanish I did Biology work. Biology I did work and the pretty girl in my class sat in front of me jejejejejje</p>
    <p>bye no school tomorrow!</p>
