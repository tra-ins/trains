    <h4>3/4/25 &#45; 4:42 PM CST &#45; "Sensible Shoes"</h4>
    <h1>Today was ok.</h1> 
    <p>In JROTC we talked about space. In CJ we finished the notes on alcohol and I rewatched s2e2 of IWTV. In Spanish we worked on our projects. In Biology we did notes. My friend basically called me queer, but what does being of "sensible shoes" mean???</p>
    <p>bye</p>
