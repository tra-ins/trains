    <h1>My height is the title. I am indeed short, like 30th percentile.</h1>
    <p>Woke up at 8:15 AM (but multiple times before), didn't bring watch (mistake), went to doctors appointment, NO SHOTS LET'S GOOOOO (for now), picked up brother from work, got Dunkin, was tardy and came near lunch during ELA. Died during lunch, caught up in ELA, math was easy I already DID THE WORK??? SLOPE IS SO EASY!!!!! WHEN ARE WE GONNA CONTINUE FUNCTIONS?????? Art was fine, I guess, extra PE was pain. I was dying during extra PE and ended up hiding in my own corner of the gym during four square so I didn't have to participate. Overall 5/10 day +5 for 2 egg and cheese sandwiches on everything bagels and orange juice (they're getting rid of Sprite I think? IDK :(().</p>
