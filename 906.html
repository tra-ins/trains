    <h4>4/7/25 &#45; 4:49 PM CDT &#45; There was School Today</h4>
    <h1>Today was ok.</h1> 
    <p>We had a 2 hour delay, but I still woke up at like 7 and didn't really go back to sleep. Sort of went in and out of consciousness. Do I really need to say what happened today? Same as usual. Same as usual. Same as usual. JROTC we did nothing and the teacher put on odd commercials. CJ my teacher put on a video about TASERs. Spanish we did a worksheet and I worked on my verbs spreadsheet. Biology we did our benchmark and I saw the pretty girl again. Heart eyes emoji. I'm enjoying Slaughterhouse-Five. I am not enjoying Blackwood Farm. I may go to the bookstore later. I'm going to rewatch the first episode of The Newsreader in the time being. Yes. Indeed.</p>
