    <h4>4/15/25 &#45; 4:39 PM CDT &#45; EOCs!</h4>
    <h1>Today was also boring.</h1> 
    <p>JROTC class was longer due to EOCs so we talked about space or jobs?? Can't remember but after I watched IWTV, worked on my script, and read. In CJ I read. In Spanish I did work. The lights went out during class and people in the hallway were screaming. In Biology I also did work.</p>
    <p>bye!</p>
