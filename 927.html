    <h4>4/28/25 &#45; 6:43 PM CDT &#45; Ah</h4>
    <h1>Today was eh.</h1> 
    <p>JROTC we talked about boring financial stuff. In CJ we did notes. And I went down to the guidance counselor about my free yearbook coming hopefully Friday 3 times. Anyway, in Spanish we did notes. And my teacher said my shirt's color was nice (some green). In Biology we did EOC practice.</p>
    <p>bye</p>
