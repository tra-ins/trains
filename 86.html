    <h4>1/8/23 &#45; 9:10 PM CST &#45; Hair</h4>
    <h1>Watched The Circle, went to Walmart and got stuff, bought OMORI on my Switch (already had Steam, bought it virtually on Switch for the exclusive stuff + I just really love the game), and had my hair and face done to prepare for tomorrow.</h1>
    <p>Also chatted with friends before the events above, but now I'm preparing for the end of Winter Break, tomorrow (Monday)...</p>
    <p>fare. well.</p>
