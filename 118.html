    <h4>2/9/23 &#45; 8:46 PM CST &#45; The H School and the National Beta Cult</h4>
    <h1>Today was interesting.</h1>
    <p>Field trip to h school: CTEs are pretty epic, gonna decide that. Also my English teacher pushed me to the front of all the guys while we were in the automotive mechanic whatever (huge) room and said that I was claustrophobic. I am not claustrophobic. Also she asked me how I ended up with this huge group of guys, and I said, "I don't know". Bus trip was smoothe and I sat next to one person on both. Someone in my class to the h school, and some person who asked me for the time on the way back. I liked this trip better than the college, I guess, it was pretty cool and interesting.</p>
    <p>We stayed in homeroom for a while until we went to math, where the teacher just kept talking about h school. Lunch was fine, asked English teacher why I got the form about the National Beta induction ceremony the day before, and she told me to yell at the actual Beta lady (whom I haven't met nor know what they look like).</p>
    <p>PE I just waited.</p>
    <p>RTI was RTI, but I didn't win the mini fridge today. Only one more shot tomorrow :(. Also math teacher came up to me and told me I should apply for the silly magnet school (applications opened) and complimented me a bunch. I said 'no thanks'.</p>
    <p>Got home, got dressed in a blue striped collared shirt (like DW Hero; that's why I chose it other than the fact it looked cool), dress pants, a suit jacket, a belt, black socks, and goofy Converse looking shoes, and I went to the school. Sat on the bleachers with the people of my grade while some kids played baseball in the gym, and we went to the auditorium and sat. All the Beta officers all had blonde hair, curls, and were white, and there was a table with candles and the principal was there with certificates. My name was called, I went on stage, shook hand with right to the principal and took the certificate with left, principal said compliments or something about achievement, walked to the president of the club, shook his hand with my right, got the pin on my suit jacket, and sat back down. It really is a cult; but at least I looked cute :)))). Got Zaxby's after, BTW.</p>
    <p>ZAXBY'S REVIEW 2: THE HISTORY TEACHER SPECIAL (social studies teacher made me order this, so I will review one last time (Hamilton??? :OO)</p>
    <p>1. big zax snack!!!!</p>
    <p>2. toast is cool ig</p>
    <p>3. i actually like the zax sauce and nuclear sauce; nuclear sauce isnt spicy tho so it sucks actually</p>
    <p>4. fries: theyre good with the sauce :)</p>
    <p>5. CHICKEN: it's ok, not great but it's ok. just ok. the sauce makes it better but it doesn't make it worth eating.</p>
    <p>overall, it's a 7.5/10. i think i'd bump the spicy chicken sandwich down to like 5/10. it's not bad by any means, but it isn't great for sure. i wouldn't eat it again.</p>
    <p>Bye!</p>
