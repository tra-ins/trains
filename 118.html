    <h4>2/10/23 &#45; 4:55 PM CST &#45; Vest</h4>
    <h1>Today was ok.</h1>
    <p>Science-- easy assignment, whatever.</p>
    <p>ELA-- pretty easy but brutal (brutal as in, Frederick Douglass' aunt getting whipped).</p>
    <p>Math was math, but OH NOOO GEOMETRY!!!!!</p>
    <p>PE-- random girls intruded on my stay near the door, went to the bathroom and unbuttoned my vest and stayed for 10 mins, went back outside without knowing that we were supposed to be chilling inside, annoying blonde girl sees me and asks annoyingly if I was in gym, comments something about me, and then I leave PE a little too early.</p>
    <p>RTI was RTI.</p>
    <p>I lost the final mini fridge. I didn't get one :(((</p>
    <p>I wore a fancy vest to school today for the first time and got a couple compliments (though like 2/3 of them were also congratulations for joining Beta), including my friend (who said I looked like I was at a casino), and my social studies teacher (I showed both my friend and my social studies teacher the suit I wore to the ceremony as well). I WAS GOING FOR GREATEST SHOWMAN OR LIKE A VICTORIAN TAVERN NOT A CASINO OR HAMILTON (my sister said Hamilton) (that's more like a tail coat or a frock coat not a MERE VEST).</p>
    <p>Won Uno, got progress reports as well. I hope my 93 in English doesn't last long :( but at least it's still all As :)</p>
    <p>Bye.</p>
