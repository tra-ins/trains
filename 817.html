    <h4>1/8/25 &#45; 5:07 PM CST &#45; OCPs</h4>
    <h1>Today felt odd-ish.</h1>
    <p>Wore my JROTC blues since I hadn't got my OCPs yet, and got fitted for them during class. It was a bit entertaining to watch the people helping out scramble around, trying to fit a group of other people. In Criminal Justice, we went over lab safety again and it was oddly peaceful. Not many people were there, so it was quiet apart from my teacher's lecture. Spanish, my teacher started talking about her uncensored history of the Americas, and we did a pre-assessment test which she demonstrated her game of "Jenga" to us. Each classmate who answered correctly got to place one Jenga block onto the teacher's wheeled cart, which would grow in size as people got answers correct. But when someone gets an answer wrong, the teacher knocks down the entire tower, giving the class 0 "points". I think she said she usually or always wins. I was more nervous about pronunciation more than anything, though I didn't answer any questions. In Biology, we had to make posters based off of the lab safety slogans we made yesterday. And so I made one. And after 4th period, I got my OCP uniform.</p>
