    <h4>12/12/24 &#45; 5:03 PM CST &#45; By Hook or by Crook (2001)</h4>
    <h1>Today was okay.</h1>
    <p>In Criminal Justice, we did probably our last test and watched more of that OJ Simpson doc. In Geometry, my teacher put on the Miracle at 34th Street (though I didn't pay attention). In English, we were supposed to read more of Act I of Macbeth, but we kind of did nothing/catch up work. And in Spanish, my teacher kept going on side tangents so I just messaged my friend for a while, and my teacher asked us what our favorite movies are... and I never tell anyone who isn't in my close circle my current, true favorite movie, but I told him about By Hook or by Crook (2001). I told him I didn't know how to explain what it's about and he said he'd check it out. And I giggled. The thing about By Hook or by Crook is that at its heart, it's about the friendship between two trans men (Val and Shy; their identities are pretty ambiguous, but personally I like to see them as being trans men, and I think that's the majority consensus, though they really are around the bounds of butch and trans man). Also there's two sex scenes (not a bad thing, but just a warning. It's hot--). We did learn more of ser vs estar though!</p>
    <p>goodbye</p>
