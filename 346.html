    <h4>9/25/23 &#45; 4:38 PM CDT &#45; Maps and Land Navigation (ft. a bumper sticker and a bracelet)</h4>
    <h1>today stinky! yeowch!</h1>
    <p>In JROTC, a speaker from the National Guard came and taught us about land navigation or something (ok but like it was lowkey super interesting because I like geography and we got a sticker and a bracelet). In Algebra, we did review for our test. In Culinary, we did another packet (18 pages but I somehow finished it before the trade school folks left). And in theater, we're now preparing to do our thirty second monologues. Great. Another win though, because I chose my monologue from the gender neutral packet (WHO NAMES THEMSELF HOODIE???) and ermmmm that's awesomesauce!</p>
