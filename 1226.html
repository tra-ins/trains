    <h4>2/21/26 &#45; 8:33 PM CST &#45; MITSKI LISTENING PARTY</h4>
    <h1>I WENT TO THE MITSKI LISTENING PARTY TODAY!!!!</h1>
    <p>laid in bed for ~2 hrs scrolling pinterest & ao3 and then i got up and worked on my SCHOOL PROJECT (!!!!!) and it's nearly complete, i just need 1 picture + to memorize a sentence. after i went to the listening party and it was so much fun!!! i had to leave during the 2nd time it was played but i really enjoyed the music, although it was very noisy and i couldn't listen to the lyrics well. plus it's of course my 1st time listeing to most of the songs so im not as familiar. i got multiple notepads, a bracelet, 3 prints of the album cover and i wore my tliisaw tour shirt and i wrote a message on notepad paper for the note wall !!!! im not much into scrapboookign so for the rest  ijust listened and talked a little to m y parents and i recorded a short clip on my 3ds heehee. also the store had a mural of the album cover at the front outside and it was so cool!!!! genuinely such a magical experience i bought the land and nathtm cds when i got home even tho i dont possess a cd player but my and mom's cars have cd players so i can listen there. but yeah it's an amazing album!!!! i think the one where mitski's singing about her cat or therealy spooky one will be my favs. or the counting one possibly. im sturugling to describe the songs but there were some with parts that drowned out all of the voices of the fans in the building and i just LISTENED! and it was heavenly! idk how im gonna function this week since im so excited + I HAVE ACTS EARLY MARCH AT THE SAME TIME AS THE HOLDFAST AGE OF SAIL UPDATE SOB . my first cds. ive never owned any cds prior. im so excited i kinda wanna get cds of p1-5 and the rest of mitski's discography! AND OCEAN RAIN BY ECHO & THE BUNNYMEN SUCH A FANTASTIC ALBUM. and boygenius ep and the record and the rest okay yeah im in the market for a cd player ill prob look for one at goodwill soon. Ah ive never wanted physical music so badly ive always been so content with downloadign music on my phone but idk this era is making me want!! lol i just realized i put that i saw mitski on 4/8 on the note but i saw her on 4/10 actually. oops! but it's no matter :)</p>
