    <h4>10/28/22 &#45; 5:55 PM CDT &#45; Reckoning</h4>
    <h1>Happy day of reckoning!!! [Birthday of friend]</h1>
    <p>"This ain't a fight club" - Substitute Teacher</p>
    <p>[RTI Period 8 classmates create a ring with the desks and FIGHT MORE]</p>
    <p>“THEY'RE JUST PLAYING!” - Classmate</p>
    <p>Had an easy quiz in science, open note yeah you know.</p>
    <p>In ELA we read Lamb to the Slaughter and it was funny ngl.</p>
    <p>In math, it was my turn for the multiplication test thing and I was SLAYING, and my only friend in the school is a guy and even though he already went, my math teacher let me pick him for the ENTIRE NEXT WEEK [I hope that girl who hates me appreciates that, because he picked her before she picked me].</p>
    <p>We did a Tennessee Governor mock election in Related Arts [Period 7] and I voted for the Democrat person. Also my teacher was wearing a Schoolhouse Rock [the bill guy from that one song] shirt, I was the only person that complemented her ahahahahahhahahaha [she said so].</p>
    <p>In RTI, we had a substitute [because my Social Studies teacher ran the mock elections in each Related Arts], and she didn't really care and my classmates were literally FIGHTING, hence the name of this update. Yeah it was chaotic, and I was just on my phone the whole time. I told my mom in a group chat with my siblings and she SNITCHED AND CALLED THE SCHOOL, AND THIS GUY EVERYONE'S AFRAID OF CAME AND LECTURED THE CLASS [HE WAS CHILL THO].</p>
