    <h4>9/20/24 &#45; 5:06 PM CDT &#45; My Teacher Can Find My Essay Now! I Was Also Saved Yesterday!</h4>
    <h1>Today was alright.</h1>
    <p>In Criminal Justice we did a personality test (I got INFP-T), in Geometry we talked about triangles more, in English we continued the test (I finished it apart from the essay section), and in Spanish we didn't do much, we had a pep rally and I didn't really pay attention, I just read The Vampire Lestat (started reading today!!). Also I received my friend's correspondence and we've been talking more and more and I just really appreciate her and yesterday I just had a moment and I think I'm fine. A moment of clarity. I think I'm fine. I also finished reading The Outcast! So good!</p>
    <p>Bye</p>
