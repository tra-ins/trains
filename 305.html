    <h1>today sucks once again</h1>
    <p>In JROTC, we practiced falling out again and then we did this exercise where we got a gummy bear (I got to eat more than 9 more though) and the color of it determined what icebreaker question you had to answer. I chose red, so I had to answer the question that if I had to choose two people to go to dinner with, who would I choose, and most of the people who got red chose like their dead family member(s)/friends and I said my mom and Winona Ryder. I feel bad lol.</p>
    <p>I feel like I should be organizing these paragraphs so whoever stumbles upon this can read it better. Anyway, Algebra we just did Algebra + there was an unexpected fire drill during OT (kinda like RTI/homeroom in a way). In Culinary Arts, we got our assigned seats, put on our chef stuff, and did a worksheet. In theatre we had to get in a group and act out a story between 2 people. Someone in my group already chose to be the director with a story that was just the 2 actors hearing a noise, getting scared, and running. I was the co-director but I had to act for one of the actors because one of them went to the guidance counselor I think. I think that's all.</p>
    <p>Bye</p>
