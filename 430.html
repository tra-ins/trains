    <h1>today stinky</h1>
    <p>In JROTC, we did our 30 step drill sequence test and our promotion test. I passed both, though I don't think I'm getting promoted. I hope some day I'll see JC again. In Algebra, I did nothing. In Culinary, we took our final and I'm pretty sure I failed, though at least I got to see my friends one last time. And in theater, I did not do very well presenting my monologue, and I turned my play in.</p>
    <p>HELP ALL OF MY GRADES R GONNA DROP TO BS I BET...</p>
