    <h4>10/3/23 &#45; 5:03 PM CDT &#45; Mean Girls Day</h4>
    <h1>today was also mid</h1>
    <p>In JROTC, we studied and I actually remember the 30 step drill sequence??? In Algebra, we did a project that wasn't much of a project, but it added more lore to the parmesan cheeseverse. In Culinary, I finished my study guide and helped pass out the cleaned uniforms to everyone, and I finished watching Mean Girls on TT (it's October 3rd!). In theater, we did more stuff for our monologues.</p>
