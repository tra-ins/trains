    <h1>Today was mid.</h1>
    <p>In AP World we did notes, and my teacher proclaimed to us that he's a monarchist. Also I got an A on the DBQ??? And an A on an assignment I didn't even finish nor turn in, so I got an A in AP World for Quarter 3!!! In English, we did a scavenger hunt. In Science, we did Nearpods. And in JROTC, we marched.</p>
