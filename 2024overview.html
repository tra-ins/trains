    <h4>1/1/25 &#45; 2:37 PM CST &#45; 2024: A Year in Review</h4>
    <h1>2024 was, well, boring. I barely remember anything.</h1>
    <p>Best parts of 2024? I got very into IWTV/The Vampire Chronicles series. Maybe reading and purchasing the books is bad. Probably. I did come back into contact with one of my friends. And I did lose interest in Ace Attorney, which is pretty much a win.</p>
    <p>Worst parts were school and existing and being horribly misunderstood by every single person in my life. And that brief "relationship"-ish thing. This year was terrible.</p>
    <p>Maybe 2026 will be my year!</p>
    <p>Third year of this website complete. Second full year. Why do I even do this anymore?</p>
