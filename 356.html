    <h4>10/5/23 &#45; 4:46 PM CDT &#45; The Midterms</h4>
    <h1>today was ok</h1>
    <p>In JROTC, I got a ONE HUNED on my midterm, in Algebra I just did nothing (taking my midterm after Fall Break). In Culinary, I got a 28/30 on my midterm, and in theater, I got a 96 (I think, it was an A at least) on my midterm (ermm had the performance of a lifetime).</p>
    <p>bye! I probably won't upload all the other updates until I come back from travel during Fall Break (hopefully by the time we get to the first anniversary of the first update, October 15th 2022!)</p>
