    <h1>watched some x files and i thogut "wow this epsiode (space) is the best episode yet!" and then i went on serialzd to log it and saw that the overall rating was under 3 stars. interesting phenomena. and then i went outside and played in the snow (now it's too sticky! it's practically ice! i jumped on the snow later and it didn't even crumble!).a after i played peace walker for a while, then i went out in the snow again i think. then i plahyed peace walker again. for most of the day. and i got distracted and downloaded a few games. then played peace walker once more. and finally i shall play on ym switch.</h1>
