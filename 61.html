    <h4>12/14/22 &#45; 5:06 PM CST &#45; Open Note</h4>
    <h1>Today was a Wednesday? It was a Wednesday. Today was fine.</h1>
    <p>In social studies we had an open note test and I somehow missed like 1 or 2 questions. I am sobbing and crying. In science, we just copied notes because we had little time. In ELA we just did a sonnet worksheet, we're gonna finish it tomorrow. In math we did math. In art we watched a terrible Christmas movie with cats in it, and I wrote a nice letter to my math teacher because I didn't want to watch the movie. RTI was RTI.</p>
    <p>I honestly can't remember anything to note in particular, so I'll just say,</p>
    <p>bye.</p>
