    <h4>1/11/23 &#45; 4:54 PM CST &#45; Aloof</h4>
    <h1>Today was fine until 7TH PERIOD PE. AT LEAST IT'S A WEDNESDAY SO NO EXTRA PE!!!</h1>
    <p>I KEEP BRINGING MY SWITCHHHH...anyways, in social studies the teacher was trying to make us play a game on some website where you're George Washington and have to make his decisions, but it wouldn't work so we ended up watching part of some documentary about the later stages of the US Revolution? IDK but it was cool, I guess. Also, like 2 of my classmates commented on my beautiful pineapple pizza laptop wallpaper, and I myself was called "good" or something like that at some point during class. In science we watched an episode of some show because the main teacher guy was absent, and the episode was about quantum stuff, IDK it was okay, and literally everyone around me was asleep or just had their head down. In ELA we did Quill and for some reason my teacher just gave me some of her bucks with my name on it. IDK but she gave it to my friend too, but I'm still kind of concerned. At least I got to admit that I didn't practice any amount of the Prologue over the weekend.</p>
    <p>Uhhh I don't have much to say about math, but the reading RTI test thing is tomorrow, so. PEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE I HATE PE I HATE GYM I HATE PHYSICAL EDUCATION I HATE PE. I KEEP GRIEVING TO THE ART TEACHER OF HOW MUCH I HATE IT, AND RIGHTFULLY SO. I LITERALLY STARED AT A FENCE AND THEN THE BLEACHERS FOR LIKE 40 MINUTES. AND THESE GIRLS KEPT KICKING BALLS AROUND ME AND I HAD TO PASS IT BACK, AND THEY ENDED UP HITTING ME AND TRYING TO APOLOGIZE, BUT I WAS ALREADY MAD FROM MY INTRUSIVE THOUGHTS AND THE SHEER FACT THAT PE EXISTS THAT I SAID NOTHING AND CONTINUED TO STARE. AND LATER THEY TRIED SAYING SORRY AGAIN BUT THEY ASKED SOME GIRL THEY WERE WITH THAT'S IN MY CLASS AND SHE WAS LIKE "oh! she doesn't like talking :)". BROOO JUST LEAVE ME ALONE AT LEAST, I CLEARLY DO NOT CARE NOR WANT TO INTERACT. Anyway, RTI was fine.</p>
    <p>TETRIS. I NEED HELP WHY IS TETRIS SO FUN AND ADDICTING???</p>
    <p>TL;DR: Today was okay except for PE, in which I was aloof (hence the title) and annoyed.</p>
    <p>bye</p>
