    <h4>3/30/23 &#45; 5:09 PM CDT &#45; Forgotten Lunchbox ft. 'The Day of Awesomeness'</h4>
    <h1>Today was also decent.</h1>
    <p>So before school, my mom told me not to forget my lunch, which was on the counter. I was like, "I would never forget my lunchbox, the last time I did was on the day of the honor roll party" or something like that, and I proceded to forget. My mom noticed I forgot it and got it to me during ELA.</p>
    <p>Also funny happy Alaska Purchase day. March 30th, 1867 (WAIT THIS IS UPDATE #167 WHICH THE 67 ALIGNS WITH THE YEAR?? ILLUMINATI CONFIRMED?)</p>
    <p>Social studies, just did notes and work about the Mexican-American War (I love imperialism and manifest destiny), The Day of Awesomeness thing from the pyramid scheme was today and I could've gone (with my crush and her friend or bf IDK IF THEY'RE DATING OR NOT BECAUSE I'VE BEEN GIVEN MIXED SIGNALS) but I immediately said no when teacher was in the middle of asking me if I was going to go, made people including ykw giggle woohoo!!!</p>
    <p>ELA, yay we finished reading the Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass (but not done with the unit since we still gotta finish the objective summary PowerPoint and do the unit test, thank God we only have to do the multiple choice section of the unit test).</p>
    <p>Uhh on the way to math, my foot like...fell weirdly? I don't know how to describe it, but it just randomly fell to the side and I almost tripped. Hurt and still hurts real bad. Finished my math test near the end of class but I never turned it in, haha.</p>
    <p>IN THEATER, MY CRUSH DOES CHOIR AND CHOIR WAS REHEARSING (for their trip or concert or whatever competition tomorrow IDK), SO THEY REHEARSED IN FRONT OF MY THEATER CLASS!!! EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Anyway, we left their rehearsal area into the...theater classroom??? Wait, I JUST REALIZED THAT I THINK THAT CLASSROOM WAS THE FORMER ART CLASSROOM BEFORE IT MOVED RIGHT NEXT TO MY SOCIAL STUDIES TEACHER'S ROOM?? I'm presenting my speech tomorrow, since we didn't have much time to do presentations. Also, too many people who presented said that they didn't like social studies and most or all of them said it was boring as their reason. Die a painful death!!!</p>
    <p>No IXL in RTI so I just chilled on my phone and stuff; factory MC world is so amazing!</p>
    <p>JTA Day 24; god only knows if it can continue due to the acceptance letter</p>
    <p>bye</p>
