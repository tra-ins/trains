    <h4>3/2/23 &#45; 6:09 PM CST &#45; Social Studies Benchmark or Something</h4>
    <h1>Today also sucked!!!</h1>
    <p>Social studies- benchmark!!! It was quite easy (except for a few questions) but it's okay because all we needed to do was try...</p>
    <p>ELA- traumatizing because I still haven't finished the PowerPoint slides for chapters 6 & 7 and those slides are due tomorrow (but there's no school tomorrow and Monday) and I was absent 2 days and I think the teacher forgot and oh God it took too long to finish chapter 5 on my own--</p>
    <p>Math- easy triangle stuff + easy test (2:25, forgot the milliseconds although I have it written down. I'm just lazy) I forgot something on the test from like yesterday that I now just realized while it hasn't been given back!!! Forgot to mention that I was asked if I was in Beta, said yes unfortunately, and got called smart near my crus--</p>
    <p>Went to art, was annoying because I couldn't think of how to draw a famous woman for Women's History Month!! I'm such a STRONG, INDEPENDENT woman.</p>
    <p>Uhh RTI IXL + took a picture of my teacher's decapitated pig (like from the pyramid scheme thingy from weeks ago) split apart by a drumstick from the band teacher while hung up on the ceiling (omg OMORI and Heathers reference???). Traumatic.</p>
    <p>Exercised again like a GIRLBOSS.</p>
    <p>Wore shorts again.</p>
    <p>Like I said, no school tomorrow because of the wind + no school Monday as a personal development day for teachers and staff or something, I don't know. As long as there isn't school I'm good.</p>
    <p>bye</p>
