    <h4>4/23/25 &#45; 5:25 PM CDT &#45; Sticky</h4>
    <h1>Today was eh.</h1> 
    <p>I woke up earlier since I had to ride the bus. In JROTC we did our inspection and then drill tests in the heat, and my silly self decided that wearing a jacket would be a good idea. It wasn't, and I was all sticky from the heat. In CJ we did notes and I rewatched s2e5 of IWTV. In Spanish we had a sub and so I did work. In Biology we did notes and work. Also I had to switch seats in the auditorium waiting for my bus since these people were bothering me with questions while I was reading. Yeah, it was rude of me... but I wanted to read in peace! One last thing The Undaunted by Alan Hart came!!</p>
    <p>bye</p>
