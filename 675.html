    <h1>Today was okay.</h1>
    <p>Criminal Justice we learned about the Due Proess amendments, and I wrote about Gideon v. Wainwright (1963). Geometry we learned more angles. English we did writing, and it was a group thing, and my group wouldn't even let me help out, they just talked about me behind my back, so I just did it alone. Spanish we talked and did a simple vocab quiz.</p>
    <p>finished writing a fic yesterday and i got my learner's permit today!!</p> 
    <p>bye bye</p>
