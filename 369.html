    <h4>10/18/23 &#45; 4:40 PM CDT &#45; Airman</h4>
    <h1>today was mid</h1>
    <p>In JROTC, the instructors talked about the week, and then we did an inspection (no discrepancies as usual), and I got promoted to Airman. Yay, I have my ranks now. In Algebra, we did more things. In Culinary, we did a lab about washing your hands (it took me like 4 tries to wash them alright lol). And in theater, we did some thing where we looked over a script and pointed out facts and made inferences about it.</p>
    <p>ok bye</p>
