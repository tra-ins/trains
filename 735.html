    <h4>10/18/24 &#45; 5:12 PM CDT &#45; I Had a Headache Among Other Unimportant Things</h4>
    <h1>Today was bad.</h1>
    <p>Criminal Justice we talked about first aid, and there was a fire drill. Geometry we did right angles similarity things. English I was struggling and I had a headache. Spanish I still had that headache for a while and I just focused on doing my workbook work. I didn't even join the Gimkit.</p>
    <p>bye</p>
