    <h1>today was alright</h1>
    <p>In JROTC, we're going to do this presentation thing tomorrow. In Algebra, we did more Algebra and I used OT to go find the rest of the moles. After Algebra, I was nearly late to Culinary because I had finally found the last 2 moles I needed, allowing me to submit the form with all 40 moles (THE SCAVENGER HUNT). Also, Culinary was pretty fun, we just had to collect our group's tools and bowls and stuff, because we're doing the playdough thing tomorrow, not today. Also I saw my regular Culinary teacher in the hallway while I was looking for the moles earlier, but she ended up leaving right before my period of Culinary started??? Anyway, I finished my theater project. Hope I win the prize for finding all of the moles!!!</p>
    <p>Bye</p>
