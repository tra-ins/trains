    <h1>school was fine</h1> 
    <p>Boo English!!! Apparently my teacher had her phone in her book???? I don't like her class. She tells us "3 minute break" and it's 20 minutes long. She plays the introduction and act 1 scene 1 of The Crucible over and over again. Also I wrote about Persona 1 or something. Well, anyway, in AV Production we did an assignment where we took pictures from a show or movie etc and said what kind of shot it was. Like close up, medium, wide, pov, etc. I chose IWTV, of course. Also that freshman asked what games I have and I just said that I was playing Pokemon Ranger, because that is the game I was playing at that instant. Algebra 2 we reviewed stuff. 4th block watched IWTV + played SMT If.</p>
    <p>bye</p>
