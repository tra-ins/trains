    <h4>11/19/22 &#45; 9:05 PM CST &#45; Bed</h4>
    <h1>Had to wait until 7 for the game to come from GameStop instead of Walmart, they didn't have it :(</h1>
    <p>I was just in bed from 8 'til three.</p>
    <p>Game is cool so far.</p>
    <p>I was playing Scarlet in bed and this bug of some sort was just climbing this wall above my bed, I was scared but didn't budge until the bug went above me. I ran out and played on the desk, until I grabbed 2 spatulas and a paper towel, climbed onto the bed and sat there eyeing the bug, hesitant to murder it. I finally mustered up the courage to destroy it, once and for all...it fell onto the bed and I screamed. I finally got it onto the spatula and flung it into the toilet of the restroom nearby. I am still scarred by this terrifying event.</p>
    <p>No spoilers!!!</p>
    <p>Okey bye</p>
