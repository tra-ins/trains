    <h4>5/17/23 &#45; 4:47 PM CDT &#45; The Paper's End</h4>
    <h1>Today was also also okay.</h1>
    <p>Uhh in social studies, I started making a mural of notes about these past 3 years in Minecraft. I'm almost done, just need to write about the drama this year. THE AWARDS ARE ON FRIDAY, YESSSSSS...also yearbooks come tomorrow.</p>
    <p>Science, turned in my paper and got 300/300. YES. Still have a 99 in social studies though. I GOT A 100 ON EVERYTHING IN SS EXCEPT LIKE A 94.5 OR 94/105 ON SOME DUMB WEBQUEST. GRRRRRR BARK BARK BARK AWOOOO</p>
    <p>Uhh ELA, easy vocab worksheet + teacher complimented vest + tie (same colors as my school's mascot) combo + I finished first and the teacher was really like "you have a logical brain". Yes, she said that verbatim. Help. At lunch, one of my classmates said my outfit looks nice or something but called me YKW GIRL. I was like, "I don't even look like her???" and then she said that we're both "quiet and smart". I was like, "wow ok...". Girl bye. ALSO, this girl from another class came to throw a cupcake at my former "friend", but ny teacher stopped her and called an admin.</p>
    <p>Hmmm math, we started a thing about what we wanted funded from the school and county. I can't remember what else happened.</p>
    <p>More Newsies in theater as usual, but near the beginning of class, the Beta lady called for me to go to her room, so I walked all the way up there, just for her to offer pizza as apart of teacher appreciation week or something. It was from a nasty place (I think the one with the really good wings tho) so I said no. Is this week just the worst week for pizza? Well anyway, these homophobic kids at my table were saying homophobic things as usual, but then one of them said that I was the last person they'd want to...m...vulgar concerning word. Thank God, lol.</p>
    <p>RTI whatever.</p>
    <p>Bye</p>
