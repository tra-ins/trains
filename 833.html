    <h4>1/24/25 &#45; 5:02 PM CST &#45; Coming Home</h4>
    <h1>Today was ok.</h1>
    <p>In JROTC we did PT stuff I was unprepared for. It randomly started snowing a little bit? Odd. In CJ we did a test and I started rewatching IWTV for the 3rd time. In Spanish I finished my Biology work from yesterday and discovered that I could play FNF on the school laptops. In Biology we did a Quizziz and then went to a pep rally. They called it "Coming Home". Like Homecoming but-- Yeah.</p>
    <p>bye</p>
