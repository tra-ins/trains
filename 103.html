    <h4>1/25/23 &#45; 4:59 PM CST &#45; Stab</h4>
    <h1>Today wasn't terrible.</h1>
    <p>Social studies study guide and 2 Kahoots (1 was the treasure game, and the other was normal). I won both Kahoots and managed to finish the study guide. Wish me luck tomorrow!! New student whom I haven't and will never interact with, by the way.</p>
    <p>Science test wasn't that bad, turned in constellation project (100!!!).</p>
    <p>ELA did ELA things. Just Romeo & Juliet. I HATE ROMEO SO MUCH!!! Also they die kind of funny; "stab" like how SPOILER ALERT Juliet stabs herself with Romeo's dagger after she sees Romeo die, lol!!! Very lol. Romeo deserved to die. I HATE ROMEO. And my friend cheated (my social studies teacher literally saw him do it) in Uno and everyone teamed up and cheated after because he did (it was only fair).</p>
    <p>Uhh math had a silly little girl emergency and probably had a silly little blood stain throughout the rest of the day.</p>
    <p>Art actually doing art things. I hate watercolors, but at least I have ideas for this!!!</p>
    <p>RTI was RTI, silly silly SILLY.</p>
    <p>bye...</p>
