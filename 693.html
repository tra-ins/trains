    <h4>9/6/24 &#45; 4:49 PM CDT &#45; Happy AAI Collection Release</h4>
    <h1>Today was eh.</h1>
    <p>In Criminal Justice we discussed police communication. In Geometry we did more translations. In English we...well...I didn't do anything...the teacher went on and on, and there was a soft lockdown. I'm not doing that essay. I just read Interview with the Vampire near the end of class. I read like 50 pages of it across today. In Spanish I got a 100 on the Chapter 1 test.</p>
