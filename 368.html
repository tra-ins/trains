    <h4>10/17/23 &#45; 4:49 PM CDT &#45; ACT</h4>
    <h1>today was alright</h1>
    <p>We went to a random classroom determined by our last names for the entire day, until 4th period, because the seniors had to take their ACTs. During this time, we were supposed to do some career test and some reading thingies, but I couldn't because my login is broken, and it was reset like 5 times and I still couldn't get in, so I just went on my phone the entire time.</p>
    <p>Finally in theater, we did like 2 improv games (I barely participated in the first, and didn't participate at all in the second), and then the teacher just let us do whatever after.</p>
    <p>yeah bye</p>
