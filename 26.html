    <h4>11/9/22 &#45; 10:43 PM CST &#45; Backpack</h4>
    <h1>What...happened??</h1>
    <p>Won a Kahoot at least...in social studies so IT WASN'T EVEN DIFFICULT AND IF I ANSWERED 2 OF THE QUESTIONS AND IF THAT GUY DIDN'T CLICK GENERAL INSTEAD OF LOYALIST ON MY SCREEN I WOULD'VE GOT THEM ALL RIGH-</p>
    <p>Science was...you guessed it! Notes. ELA was...Frankenstein (at least we're finishing it) (also I hate Victor so much).</p>
    <p>In math my teacher did a bet if he made this paper ball into the trash can, he'd give us the day off, and if he didn't, that guy [unnamed] would have to hold my backpack for the rest of the week. And my math teacher walked up to the trash can and threw it in. L!!!!!!!!!!</p>
    <p>Art was art, but it was okay, I guess. RTI was RTI. God I love Tetris.</p>
    <p>Bye</p>
