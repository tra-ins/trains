    <h4>4/24/25 &#45; 4:57 PM CDT &#45; Why Though?</h4>
    <h1>Today was eh.</h1> 
    <p>JROTC we talked about boring job stuff or whatever. CJ did notes. Spanish did work...During lunch I was peacefully sitting, reading a book (The Iliad, of course) when this fellow walks up to my table and sits across from me. He askes me, "What are your pronouns?" This may seem like an innocent question. But he didn't even say "Hi!" or "What's your name?" first. He spoke in a manner which I could only interpret as mocking due to my lonely and queer appearance. Gender noncomfority when mentioned is always the butt of the joke at my school, so why would I take this guy seriously? I don't even need to answer the question if he was being serious. It's not his business. It's like when my Spanish teacher this semester asked me if I was trans. It is none of her business whether I am or not. I switch seats and he says to his guy friends like "awww" or something and I hear laughing. I don't remember exact details other than that he wore red and had silly-looking hair in my opinion. I was unnerved and I tried to escape but I didn't think anyone would appreciate me sitting at their table. So I put my book away and sat there and waited. Also during Spanish I got a form for the Spanish National Honor Society. I probably won't do it, seeing that it's like a more involved version of Beta. In Biology I finished the last of my assignments and read.</p>
