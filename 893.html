    <h4>3/25/25 &#45; 5:08 PM CDT &#45; Please Don't Smell It</h4>
    <h1>Today was ok.</h1> 
    <p>Back to school! Since the Juniors are taking their ACTs, we had to go into classrooms designated by last name and take this ACT practice test. We did all of the parts. It was grueling. I rewatched IWTV s2e6 and read after. We went to Biology and did work after. That's all. Why can I smell The Blood. Please don't smell it on my person.</p>
    <p>bye</p>
