    <h4>2/16/23 &#45; 1:48 PM CST &#45; Play (ft. Leaving Early)</h4>
    <h1>Today is pretty good so far?</h1>
    <p>Alright, so we went to homeroom and I just played Papa Louie games on my phone. Played Tetris and Minecraft during class until we had to leave to watch this play about two African-American educators of the county I live in. Also my English teacher said my vest looked nice while on the way to the auditorium.</p>
    <p>So we went to the auditorium and I sat next to this one guy who I've mentioned lots of times (not my friend and not that one girl) and he was waving to all his friends from his old school. I ended up switching seats with him and we were both chill. Sat behind my friend's friend who talked to me a little before and after the play. The play was a 6/10, all it really was was like a few songs about telling your story and the light or something, and literally how it would go was like: 'I pray to God, also can you tell me your life story?' '[historical figure of the county I live in explains their life story like they're reciting a Wikipedia article'. Yes, they sung about God and the light, weird? Like that's not even what the play was about, no? I get you're Christian but not all of us are, bestie, plus you don't have to make it relate to the lives of these people. They could've sung their stories or at least acted them out?? Like I would've loved to see them act out the story of the teacher lady when she went to the courthouse and was stopped by some white guy with her class. Interesting topic, poor execution. Also the guy I sat next to made me clap at the end.</p>
    <p>We went back to homeroom and went on our phones, until lunch, where we left and ate at our tables. Someone in my class told me that my vest looked cute while walking there and touched it.</p>
    <p>At lunch I talked to my friend and played Uno (which ended up not ending in time to leave). Teachers came by and the computer teacher patted me on the back and said something to me, I couldn't hear it correctly but HI. LOVE YOU MRS. ___.</p>
    <p>Went back to homeroom and played on my phone. Ended up finishing Puyo Puyo Tetris 2 after not having the time to complete the main story. Also that person in my class from before asked if my dog (my watch face) was a cat. I showed her and she said my dog looked cute. OREO IS NOT A CAT.</p>
    <p>We left 3 hours early (so like 12:30, but my bus came around 12:50/1) because of the weather (stormy/there were talks of a tornado warning anyway), so all I did today was watch a play and play on my phone, no learning involved!!!!</p>
    <p>I wore black pants and a red t-shirt (like the same as what I wore on halloween as a part of my costume), with a plaid sort of vest that was black, grey, and red, sort of like a mix of what my mom would wear and my 7TH GRADE US HISTORY TEACHER (I HATE HER). 2 compliments moment.</p>
    <p>IDK what to do now since I'm home. Work on my science paper? We'll see right now.</p>
    <p>Bye.</p>
