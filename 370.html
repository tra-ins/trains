    <h4>10/19/23 &#45; 4:48 PM CDT &#45; Dishwashing</h4>
    <h1>today was also mid</h1>
    <p>In JROTC we did something. Honestly, I completely forgot. In Algebra, we did multiplying polynomials. In Culinary, we did a lab about washing dishes (like, we washed dishes and made a small little poster). In theater, we did a thing about Constantin Stanislavski or something, and we had to do a worksheet about like 4 things an actor should know from a script or something?? And then we watched Cars and wrote the objective, obstacle, stakes, and tactics.</p>
    <p>yeah bye</p>
