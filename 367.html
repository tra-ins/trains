    <h4>10/16/23 &#45; 4:58 PM CDT &#45; Polynomial</h4>
    <h1>today was meh</h1>
    <p>In JROTC, my instructor told the class multiple times about me going to Puerto Rico (shut up pls), also my silly JROTC senior crush said something unrelated but still after my instructor said so in the other classroom, so ummm they're totally in love with me (no they aren't I'm not even a senior). And there was some recruiters or whatever.</p>
    <p>In Algebra, I took my midterm and got a 99 apparently. Also we started talking about polynomials. In Culinary, we did more math. And in theater, we did some thingy with social media or whatever, I didn't participate.</p>
    <p>bye</p>
