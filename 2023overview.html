    <h4>1/1/24 &#45; 4:08 PM CST &#45; 2023: A Year in Review</h4>
    <h1>2023 was boring, and it went by too fast. Not quite a repeat of 2022, but still...meh.</h1>
    <p>Best parts of 2023? I don't really know. Making new online friends, I guess.</p>
    <p>Worst parts were like, everything related to school, and falling out with my old friends, and becoming more obsessed with the Victorian era + the Ace Attorney obsession...</p>
    <p>I don't have much else to say. Maybe 2025 will be my year.</p>
    <p>The first full year, and technically the second year of the website, complete!</p>
