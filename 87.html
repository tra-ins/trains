    <h4>1/9/23 &#45; 4:50 PM CST &#45; Back 2 School</h4>
    <h1>Today was surprisingly not bad.</h1>
    <p>Chatted a little in homeroom and social studies itself was fine (I have to wait until WEDNESDAY to know what I got on the Teams quiz, because I always get something wrong somehow). In ELA I accidentally sat in my friend's seat somehow (told him after and he made fun of me. disappointed), and sometime after, my teacher was asking the class about the word for when an inanimate object is treated as a human (not verbatim, but the same thing) (THIS HAS TO DO WITH ROMEO AND JULIET I SWEAR) (PERSONIFICATION) and she walked up to me and said something ALONG THE LINES OF (NOT VERBATIM, I SUCK AT REMEMBERING), "I know you know it, don't say it" and pointed at me. I was confused but then I realized it was an easy question, but I wouldn't have raised my hand anyway...at lunch, I got my friend's address from one of his other friends. I don't know what to do with this information. In math, we did math and it was boring, but he went on about what he's gonna do for pi day while talking about imperfect squares or something.</p>
    <p>So, extra PE is back, and I have PE this quarter. So double PE on Mondays (today) and Tuesdays! I hate PE, but I did ask the art teacher if I could come during PE and she said just to come today (and she said she'd ask or email or something), so I did. And it was boring. Luckily, my friend randomly came during class (he has drama/theater this quarter), I think he has 7th period extra PE and 8th period theater? I don't know. But he was a bit annoying, as usual. And for extra PE I just waited it out (like actual PE) and went up to one of the coaches (like, I've been friends or something with him. not a PE teacher but don't know how to describe him) and talked to him about PE, and I was saying how much I hate sports and soccer (I played soccer, for context) and then he told me he was the soccer coach. I should've known since he kept asking for more girls to tryout. I was begging for forgiveness and then he asked me to tryout, I of course said no, and then offered for me to become the manager. I was skeptical, and I still am, but I accepted the offer and next week I'm trying it out. Oh God. What have I done? At least I got him to get the PE teachers to let us play kickball tomorrow.</p>
    <p>I don't feel like dividing the paragraphs into smaller paragraphs, so huge L if you have to read all of that.</p>
    <p>Uh yeah. That's it, bye.</p>
