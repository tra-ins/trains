    <h4>4/11/25 &#45; 4:49 PM CDT &#45; Unit Inspection</h4>
    <h1>Today was ?????? I'm conflicted.</h1> 
    <p>I forgot to give my mom my clothes to iron last night so I had to wait for her to iron this morning. I still got to school before we're released to our first period. JROTC we sat in the other classroom and listened to the unit briefing slides presented. The inspector had a lot to say about it. I was yawning. In CJ we went outside to fly drones, however, it was so windy that one of the drones was lost and we had to go back inside and do whatever. I read the entire rest of the class. Then we went to the aux gym for the unit inspection. I stood with the other few in blues. The inspection took like an hour, and my entire body ached after we were done being at attention/parade rest. The inspector asked me my grade, if I was in the program last year, if I would return next year, and what I had for dinner last night. I said lasagna. I went to lunch after, then began to do work in Spanish. Then I went to Biology and did some worksheets. I hate RNA.</p>
    <p>bye!</p>
