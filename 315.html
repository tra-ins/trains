    <h4>8/25/23 &#45; 2:38 PM CDT &#45; Not Fitted</h4>
    <h1>today sucky suck suck suck suck</h1>
    <p>Theater group thing but my group went FIRST because of the dumb chorus leader. Anyway, in JROTC I stood for ONE HOUR waiting to be fitted, and when I finally got pants to try on, I never got my turn and one of the cadet officers was like "1st block is all done!" knowing well that I was certainly not finished. In Algebra we had a very easy test.</p>
    <p>In Culinary Arts, we were given a choice of being bored, or getting a job. I chose the former and just scrolled TikTok for two hours.</p>
    <p>Bye</p>
