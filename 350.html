    <h4>9/29/23 &#45; 4:34 PM CDT &#45; Parmesan</h4>
    <h1>today was mid</h1>
    <p>In JROTC, we did stretches and stuff, and I got 6,390 steps??? HELP??? In my healthy habits era??? In Algebra, we did stuff like asymptotes or whatever. In Culinary, we did a test, and I got a ONE HUNED!!! WOOOOOOOOOOOO!!! In theater, I performed my monologue. There was also a fire drill, it might've been an actual fire but I don't know, so. And, we started writing our monologue for the midterm, and I wrote it about a guy trying to prove their innocence about how they didn't steal 100 pounds of parmesan cheese from Emilia-Romagna.</p>
