    <h4>9/27/23 &#45; 4:29 PM CDT &#45; Local Teen is Denied the Chance to Take an F on an Assignment</h4>
    <h1>today stinky as well well more well.</h1>
    <p>In JROTC we practiced the 30 step drill thing again, in Algebra we did functions, in Culinary I did nothing, and in theater, we're performing tomorrow + I cried because the teacher wouldn't let me take an F and some kid came up to me and pat me on the back and asked me stuff, and then when I politely said I would like to be alone, she just went back and said something that sounded rude, I don't know, couldn't hear well. Who knew that you could cry whilst in theater class listening to a song from an Ace Attorney game?</p>
