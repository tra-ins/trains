    <h4>10/31/22 &#45; 7:41 PM CDT &#45; Quarter 1 Honor Roll Post</h4>
    <h1>The 1st real post is kind of sad? Whaaat?? Anyway, without further a do, I will now compile a list of reasons why I did not go to that awful party!</h1>
    <ol>
    <li>Sounded boring</li>
    <li>Skipping math is cool but there are even worse classes to skip; is it really worth it? Slope is easy anyway</li>
    <li>Nobody to talk to</li>
    <li>Little Caesar's isn't even that good of a pizza place. Also cookies and brownies are fine but why. Just why. Litle Caesar's is just too often</li>
    <li>Also I don't want to have diarrhea, thank you very much.</li>
    <li>Pink hoodie girl and black/blue hoodie guy who I will not name on this website would be there</li>
    <li>Possibly outside?? Ew</li>
    <li>Probably no laptops or phones, laptops would die anyway but STILL</li>
    <li>I don't really deserve anything special?? Quarter 1 kind of sucked for me as a person</li>
    <li>I don't want to celebrate or remember anything related to Quarter 1 or school relalted in general</li>
    <li>I was already going to go to Dave & Buster's for the "occasion" but I guess my mom forgot? Like it's been WEEKS, might I add.</li>
    <li>I never get anything, not even a celebration or something like that for A/B honor roll</li>
    <li>It's not really special</li>
    <li>Not very important</li>
    <li>Worthless in the end</li>
    <li>I wanted to be unpredictable in a sense, that any teacher would sound surprised that I didn't go</li>
    <li>You have to endure hardships and not to pretend that they're not there. Today is just another Monday and going to that party would've either worsened the day or made it the same. A gradual but steady buildup of self confidence through doubt and not caring, mind absent from classmates and focused on achieving goals and feats, having little to no interaction will further this by showing to the world that I do not care for what it brings me, what anyone thinks about me, and what anyone says about myself and that eventually, I'll make out of it. Also Stoicism is kind of cool, not gonna lie, though this is more of just my own beliefs rather then referencing Stoicism itself.</li>
    <li>Tony Awards [Theater awards] but worse.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Was clearly a rational decision on my part, and I could add more reasons if I think of anything. But this move I have done was sofisticated but calculated in terms of the pros and cons, and the "impact". I have no regrets.</p>
