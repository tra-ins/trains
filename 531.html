    <h4>3/28/24 &#45; 4:43 PM CDT &#45; Raiders</h4>
    <h1>Today was eh.</h1>
    <p>In AP World we did notes, and I found out that I got a 5/7 on the DBQ. Just missed the EBD and complexity points. In English, we finally redid the practice EOC. In Science, we watched a video and did an escape room, and I got my report card (all As for quarter 3). In JROTC we hiked a trail and visited the Raiders course.</p>
