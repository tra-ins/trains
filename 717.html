    <h4>9/30/24 &#45; 5:02 PM CDT &#45; PSATs Soon!</h4>
    <h1>Criminal Justice we discussed safety carrying guns while hunting. Geometry we did a paper of notes that was pretty quick, and I spent the rest of my time rewatching episode 2 of IWTV. In school. I rewatched IWTV in school. Probably not the most egregious media I've consumed while in class. In English we learned about intrinsic and extrinsic rewards, amd operant conditioning. In Spanish I went to the Guidance Counselor's office and downloaded some app to use to take the PSAT soon, and I did a Gimkit and quiz. I will probably miss Thursday and Friday because my school reinstated this exam exemption rule, and so far it looks like I'll be exempt from every midterm from my classes this semester. Though my English grade may plummet before then. Plus there's Fall Break after, so I won't update this website until I come back (since I don't have a way of updating it outside of my huge laptop).</h1>
