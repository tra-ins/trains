    <h4>4/25/24 &#45; 4:42 PM CDT &#45; Help Me I Think I Saw My English Teacher From Last Year</h4>
    <h1>Today was mediocre.</h1>
    <p>AP World did notes and an MCQ. English finished The Outsiders. Science did something easy and finished my AP World homework from yesterday. JROTC did Crosswords. I swear. I think. I might've saw my English teacher from last year while walking out the door. I felt her presence. I swear I heard her voice. Maybe I'm seeing and hearing things.</p>
    <p>bye</p>
