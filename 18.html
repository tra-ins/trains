    <h1>Odd Tuesday, but not bad?</h1>
    <p>No science [B DAYS], so we had split list and I was sent to ENGLISH WOOOOO!!!!!! I LOVE MY TEACHER AND SHE JUST LET US DO INDEPENDENT WORK OR PLAY A GAME SILENTLY AND I LITERALLY GRINDED TETRIS NON-STOP FOR OVER AN HOUR [she made me sit next to pink hoodie girl yk who but whatever]. TETRIS I LOVE TETRIS SO MUCH!!!</p>
    <p>Actual English class was cool, I guess. Also might've answered with something unrelated to one of the questions, BUT SHUT UP LET ME HAVE MY MOMENT!!!</p>
    <p>Lunch and math boring as usual, though we had a math test which was easy? Might've messed something up somehow, like I always do.</p>
    <p>Art was okay. I finished my drawing and decided to paint, BUT OH MY GOD THAT WAS A MISTAKE!!! I LITERALLY DIDN'T HAVE TO USE PAINT FOR ANYTHING OTHER THAN THE FIGURE BUT STILL USED IT???? I AM SO DUMB OMG I MESSED ALL OF IT UP AND I MIGHT HAVE TO REDRAW IT!!!! Also she commented on my pineapple pizza art, AGAIN. I love that woman.</p>
    <p>PE was PE. Actually it was fine with yk who [the guy, my sorta friend] and we talked a bit and I chilled with one of my favorite teachers/coach I don't know, lol.</p>
    <p>Also now a few people keep calling me Mrs. [the last name of another guy who I enjoy talking to sometimes], and it's SO ANNOYINGGGGG. I ASK ONE TOO MANY QUESTIONS AND HE GAVE ME 2 OF MY English teacher's CURRENCY [I was laughing because I thought it was funny, AND the 2 bucks are still in my backpack loool].</p>
    <p>NNN, I guess. I'm not a guy, but if I was, I still wouldn't care about the "challenge". I already immediately failed No Simp September, lol. N</p>
