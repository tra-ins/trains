    <h1>played wii with my sister, went shopping at an outlet mall kinda place (I didn't buy anything though). Watched a movie and ate cookies after. Played a bit of persona. I didn't forget to update the website, it's just that my sister's come home for a day and so I must spend time with her. That's all.</h1> 
    <p>i never forget. i'll update 4 12/28 later</p>
    <p>bye</p>
