    <h4>9/27/24 &#45; 4:53 PM CDT &#45; All of My Old Friends Are Doing Homecoming Tomorrow!</h4>
    <h1>Criminal Justice these 2 guys came in and talked about how bad drug overdosing is. Geometry we learned about angles of polygons and stuff. English we read more of Night. Spanish we did a quiz and a Gimkit and other work. And now my friends are telling me about how Homecoming is tomorrow for them. I don't think I ever mentioned that last week was Homecoming week at my school? I just don't care enough to learn anything about it at my school, lol.</h1>
