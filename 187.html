    <h4>4/19/23 &#45; 4:46 PM CDT &#45; TCAP Day 3 - The Admin, and Yes, I Did Know About the Vest, I Literally Mentioned It That Day</h4>
    <h1>TCAP ELA part 3; today wasn't great.</h1>
    <p>Homeroom! Ok, so my ss teacher mad at the folks and was telling me about how the science teacher emailed her about the thing yesterday and my ELA teacher was saying stuff about it and the vest she wore that one day...anyway, we talked a bit.</p>
    <p>TCAP- 13 questions; fairly easy, something about a guy moving out west and a photographer. After, we just watched Zootopia and I went to the office of one of the admins to talk about the whole situation yesterday. Honestly, I just told him to warn the kid and get him to leave me alone, so that's that really.</p>
    <p>We went to ELA after and then the teacher was asking me about the situation, again, but we just did Space Race and watched Harriet. And after lunch, the ELA teacher asked me out of the classroom who was 'bullying' me and that she'd be mean to them or something, something something smart likes my wardrobe whatever. I struggled to make eye contact at that time...because I really didn't care?</p>
    <p>After was math, in which I got there early as usual, and was asked if I wanted anything from that IA science guy who sells food and drinks, I said no, obviously. After, the math teacher asked me about the situation, once again. The same questions. Ugggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh when will people forget about this.</p>
    <p>Theater teacher made us go to PE, in which I paced around for a couple minutes until I sat back down at my usual area. Folks were playing volleyball or something and accidentally got the ball over to me, so I stood up, stopped the ball, and kicked it back fluidly. Yay, I didn't screw something up! Oh, it came back again at some point, but I just threw it underhand back while sitting down.</p>
    <p>RTI whatever the usual, at least it was RTI. I hope tomorrow's like Tuesday so we'd social studies for 2 hours :)</p>
    <p>JTA Day 43</p>
    <p>Bye.</p>
