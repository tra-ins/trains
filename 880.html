    <h4>3/12/25 &#45; 4:36 PM CDT &#45; DE Psychology</h4>
    <h1>Today was ok.</h1> 
    <p>In JROTC we did an inspection and marched. In CJ we did a test. I went to the guidance counselor to change Advanced Spanish 3 to DE Psychology and I watched IWTV s2e5 as I waited. Then I did a survey in the small theater about whether or not I've taken drugs or smoked or drank before and if I'm depressed. In Spanish we did a group chat conversation and my travel agency partner and I had to discuss pets. In Biology I read.</p>
    <p>ok bye</p>
