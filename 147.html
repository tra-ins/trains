    <h4>3/10/23 &#45; 5:34 PM CST &#45; Fault</h4>
    <h1>Today was also mediocre.</h1>
    <p>Science notes, we live close to a fault line or whatever and at any moment the tectonic plates could do their thingy IDK transform boundary and cause a bunch of really bad earthquakes, and we'll all be screwed!</p>
    <p>ELA- grammar and I actually finished chapter 8 before lunch. Huh. Also Amplify is transphobic--ONE MORE THING, I FORGOT TO MENTION BUT TODAY MY TEACHER GOT MAD BECAUSE SHE WENT THROUGH THE TROUBLE OF FINDING PEACH DUM DUMS WITH ONE OF MY CLASSMATES AND I DIDN'T THANK HER WHEN I WAS LIKE 'NO, MRS.[]'. I FELT TERRIBLE FOR NOT APOLOGIZING.</p>
    <p>Finished math benchmark and laptop nearly died.</p>
    <p>PE soccer by myself, yeah whatever.</p>
    <p>On the way back from PE, I accidentally stepped on some girl's shoe and she GLARED at me even though I audibly and clearly apologized. A few moments after, I and a different girl accidentally mutually stepped on each others' shoes and she apologized and I did too.</p>
    <p>RTI in other ELA teacher not mine again. She caught me on my phone but didn't see my earbuds.</p>
    <p>JTA Day 6.</p>
    <p>bye.</p>
