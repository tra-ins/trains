    <h4>1/30/23 &#45; 5:07 PM CST &#45; Dodgeball</h4>
    <h1>A fine Monday.</h1>
    <p>We finally started the War of 1812 in class. I'm actually crying tears of happiness, finally, FINALLY! Also she played the Johnny Horton Battle of New Orleans song and I'm very mad right now, because I've been recovering from my brief 1812 addiction from late 2022 when I was in--</p>
    <p>Uhh ELA did Quill and just played Tetris after. Also my friend is very mad at me from lunch, so I'd advise myself to stay put and be ready for the worst--</p>
    <p>Math was math, whatever functions not hard, I had to go PE because none of the teachers were there but we played dodgeball and I was mid at throwing the balls (they're bigger than my hands okay)--</p>
    <p>No extra PE because of the glaring lack of PE teachers, RTI was RTI.</p>
    <p>If there's snow/ice tonight, we might not have school :D but we probably will have school D:</p>
    <p>Bye.</p>
