    <h4>12/5/24 &#45; 4:46 PM CST &#45; I Have Math EOCs Next Week</h4>
    <h1>Took English EOC subpart 3 today. Today was a day.</h1>
    <p>20 questions. I did awful though. We went to Geometry after and I played Pokemon and read MtD and I did exactly that until we went to 1st period during 4th period and my criminal justice teacher talked about incarceration eras and then I did exactly what I had been doing the entire day other than EOCs.</p>
    <p>goodbye</p>
