    <h4>11/15/22 &#45; 5:01 PM CST &#45; Crying?</h4>
    <h1>It's been a month since the first day!!!</h1>
    <p>Someone thought I was crying at lunch LOOOOOOOOOOOL I was just bored and playing the entire soundtrack of Pokemon (too lazy to put the accent) Black and White in my head.</p>
    <p>Science boring, ELA boring but easy and I got 2nd, then first in a Volume 1 of Gris Grimly's Frankenstein Quizziz and somehow won one about horror characters, even though I don't know any nor watch any horror movies, but yay, 7 mints. Math boring, art fine, PE suffering, yeah that's about it.</p>
    <p>Bye</p>
