    <h4>9/19/24 &#45; 4:48 PM CDT &#45; I Finished the Essay! But My Teacher Can't Find it? I Submitted it on Teams.</h4>
    <h1>Today was also boring.</h1>
    <p>In Criminal Justice we talked about the 4th Amendment. In Geometry we talked about isosceles triangles. In English we were going to do a socratic seminar but only one person participated, so the teacher is making us do a super difficult unit test (read title). In Spanish we learned about possessive adjectives.</p>
    <p>Bye</p>
