    <h4>10/15/24 &#45; 4:31 PM CDT &#45; PSATs</h4>
    <h1>I woke up at 3 am randomly but I did go back to sleep! Getting new sheets and pillows thankfully! Plus apparently it was probably my sun burns flaring up, because I was still itchy with the sheets my mom lent me. Today was alright.</h1>
    <p>Went straight to the testing room to take the PSAT. It was, well, the reading and writing section was fine, it did mention Rina Sawayama in a small passage about hyperpop, so that was pretty cool. The test was 3 hours long, so I went to a classroom where my last name and the other last names around it in letter order were supposed to stay, since testing for ACTs (and Sophomores + Juniors did a practice ACT) was today too. Thankfully, I only had to go to Spanish today! And I got to rewatch S1E5 of IWTV and read TQOTD and eat mediocre school spaghetti while waiting until 4th block. In Spanish class I was just focused on my workbook. Someone lost their airpods and was trying to find them, I recall.</p>
    <p>bye..ALSO HAPPY ONE YEAR SINCE I SAW RIDE THE CYCLONE LOCALLY!!! YAY!!!!!</p>
