    <h4>2/9/24 &#45; 4:47 PM CST &#45; Weight Room</h4>
    <h1>Today sucks as well.</h1>
    <p>In AP World we did a DBQ thing. In English we continued to watch The Odyssey. In Physical Science we did Gimkits (I carried btw). In JROTC we did weights in the weight room. And I stood there for an hour and did nothing.</p>
