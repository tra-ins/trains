    <h4>4/1/25 &#45; 4:46 PM CDT &#45; Most Boring April Fools?</h4>
    <h1>Today was fine.</h1> 
    <p>In JROTC we talked about college. In CJ we did notes on tactical entry once more. In Spanish we did a worksheet on the preterite tense. And in Biology we did notes. I'm going to see Shrek the Musical during 2nd block on Friday, and benchmarks are on Friday. Fun! And the pretty girl in Biology is still indeed quite pretty. AND in Biology we're doing that strawberry DNA lab from the 7th grade on Friday (?). Imagine if we partner up and I'm with her!!! I probably will be with the people at my table. Whatever. ALSO I SWEAR NOBODY ACKNOWLEDGED APRIL FOOLS.</p>
    <p>bye</p>
