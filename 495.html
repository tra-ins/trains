    <h4>2/21/24 &#45; 4:28 PM CST &#45; Mandatory Extra Credit</h4>
    <h1>Today was also horrible.</h1>
    <p>AP World did notes again, and there's a mandatory extra credit assignment in Teams and like 9 overdue assignments I'm speedrunning tonight, ughhh... In English, we continued to read The Odyssey. In Science, we did a bit of notes. In JROTC, we marched outside, and I got called to the guidance counselor about my schedule, but they were late and I'm doing it tomorrow instead.</p>
    <p>bye</p>
