    <p>Ah yes, the RTI experience! Wait, this doesn't have to do with the title of this update--</p>
    <p>While my bus was at a stop [there were only a few before mine at this point], the cooler started leaking and the bus started smoking, so the bus driver shut off the bus and we evacuated. Honestly, we all thought it'd explode but thank God it didn't!!! We went back inside to the back of the bus after and had to wait like around 10 or 20 minutes for another bus to come so the bus driver could finish taking us home. It was only scary for like a minute and has no lasting significance, but I still think it'd be fun to document the experience here!!! Also, I have 2 videos but I don't feel like sending them here.</p>
    <p>Oh yeah, I have a debate in English class tomorrow, I'm nervous 'cause my opening argument might take more than a minute to say, AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT MY GROUP MEMBERS HAVE WRITTEN, PLUS I WROTE TOO MUCH IN THE BOXES WE WERE SUPPOSED TO DO AS A TEAM [WE DID BUT I WROTE A LOT MORE] AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!</p>
    <p>Uhhh, oh yeah, report cards, that doesn't matter :)</p>
    <p>Well then, farewell! [I am so sorry for this]</p>
