    <h4>4/9/24 &#45; 4:47 PM CDT &#45; SEEING MITSKI TOMORROW?</h4>
    <h1>my mom was werong im seeing mitski tomorrow not thursday RAHHHHHHHH also today bad</h1>
    <p>AP World did not do that SAQ from yesterday nor make progress on the DBQ that is now due tomorrow night. English we had to do some test and write an essay. The essay was supposed to be informational but I wrote an argumentative essay??? Help?? Science did a group poster thing. JROTC did a group rocket thing and did not have a partner so I worked alone and did not do anything. I twiddled my thumbs and listened to Julien Baker for an hour.</p>
    <p>that's all!!! byeee!!!</p>
