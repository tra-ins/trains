    <h4>11/28/22 &#45; 5:50 PM CST &#45; Bill of Rights</h4>
    <h1>Monday, social studies was the Bill of Rights (taught by the principal, RAPPS).</h1>
    <p>ELA was Shakespeare (yay we're finally starting it), math was fine, art was okay, RTI was RTI. I was super excited to say "the right to bear arms" as the Second Amendment to the Constitution, so. I was doing Duolingo lessons during RTI and listening to music, and I heard my teacher say "[my name] heard me" and I was like "Huh? What?" and she realized I had earbuds in.</p>
    <p>Alright, bye.</p>
