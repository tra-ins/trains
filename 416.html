    <h1>today sucks</h1>
    <p>As I am typing this, I have just realized that I kept putting the summary in the header and not the paragraphs. So help me God. The first 4 episodes (already watched episode 1 when it got leaked) of the Total Drama reboot were released today, and ummm YAY MKULIA but boooo Ripaxel... Lord. Anyway, math EOCs started today, and I did part 1 today. In JROTC, I lowkey forgot what we did. In Culinary, Chef came back finally and made us do textbook work. I HATE SALADS. And in theater, we performed the group thing, and now we're starting our final project. Oh boy.</p>
    <p>Bye</p>
