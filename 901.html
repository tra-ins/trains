    <h4>4/2/25 &#45; 5:08 PM CDT &#45; Most Boring Day??</h4>
    <h1>Today was eh.</h1> 
    <p>In JROTC we did our inspection and then practiced rifles and it was so hot that I went back to the classroom and took my jacket off and got a free water from my instructor. Also I couldn't untie my shoes. And we didn't go outside since the state decided to use human feces as fertilizer and it smelled awful. In CJ we finished our tactical entry notes, I rewatched s1e2 of IWTV. In Spanish we did a worksheet on the preterit tense for -er verbs and did another stage of our conversation project. In Biology the pretty girl wasn't there and I was sad :(</p>
    <p>bye</p>
