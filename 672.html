    <h1>Today was eh.</h1>
    <p>Criminal Justice I got a hundred on a test and my teacher called me sir, then immediately corrected himself to ma'am. He was right the first time! Heart emoji! We also learned about handcuffs. Geometry was boring we learned more about angles. English I did nothing. Spanish we learned some more Spanish, and we learned about Mexico City.</p>
