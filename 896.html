    <h4>3/28/25 &#45; 4:59 PM CDT &#45; Forever Is A Feeling</h4>
    <h1>Today was eh.</h1> 
    <p>In JROTC we went to the library due to the field trip so I finished rewatching IWTV (2022-) and read a bit. In CJ a probation officer came as a guest speaker, called me sir, and I sort of liked him. I called him "small fry" in my head. In Spanish my teacher let us all on our phones so I read then watched Battleship Potemkin. In Biology we did work and notes and I wish I wasn't shy so I could talk to the pretty girl in my class. Did not help that I was listening to Forever Is A Feeling for most of the day, so I was quite emotional. Stream it!!</p>
    <p>bye</p>
