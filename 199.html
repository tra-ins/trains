    <h4>5/1/23 &#45; 5:00 PM CDT &#45; Hook and Machete</h4>
    <h1>Today was okay, I guess.</h1>
    <p>We had assembly today because I guess they didn't on Friday. Boo. Anyway, in social studies, we just did a webquest about the three branches of government (got 100/100), and I got stopped by my teacher, who in assembly had asked me about IA. May or may not have accidentally swore in front of my teacher, but shhhhhhh it just slipped ooooouuuuuutttt....anyway, as I was saying, I texted my mom to call the IA lady, and the IA lady ended up calling her, and finally, FINALLY, I AM FREE FROM THE CLUTCHES OF IA!!! I think. I don't feel like confirming with my mom that that's what she actually did, but I am super excited for the upcoming civics project!!!!</p>
    <p>After, we went to ELA and my teacher called me something along the lines of a "kind soul". I can't remember because when she said it, I wasn't paying attention fully. But she did call the Soviet hammer and sickle a "hook and machete". I want to die.</p>
    <p>We went to math, where the girls (my team) (ok maybe I don't fully identify with that) apparently continued to win without me. Actually now we're winning by a very large margin against the boys. But while we were in the hallway waiting for the bathrooms, I swear I heard someone playing I See Stars from Mean Girls the Musical. Help.</p>
    <p>Theater, we finished Shrek the Musical and it was beautiful. Fantastic.</p>
    <p>And in extra PE, we just did down and backs (not the pacer I swear), and people keep chanting my name. It was weird and stressed me out too much.</p>
    <p>bye</p>
