    <h4>5/7/24 &#45; 4:42 PM CDT &#45; I Will Fail This AP Exam</h4>
    <h1>Today was mediocre.</h1>
    <p>AP World watched videos. I am failing that exam. English won a Kahoot and got all 40 questions right, and got 3rd place on another Kahoot. Science did a quick assignment. JROTC didn't do much.</p>
    <p>Bye</p>
