    <h4>9/11/23 &#45; 4:42 PM CDT &#45; Happy 9/11!</h4>
    <h1>today was boring</h1>
    <p>In JROTC we just talked about 9/11, and then a navy guy came to speak for like 20 minutes. In Algebra, we just did math or something. In Culinary, we took a test of chapter 10 (I definitely failed), and did more worksheets. Oh my God. And in theater, we restarted this one thing we were watching and also had to do a worksheet about it.</p>
    <p>yea bye</p>
