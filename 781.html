    <h4>12/3/24 &#45; 4:49 PM CST &#45; EOCs Begin</h4>
    <h1>Took English EOC subpart 1 today. Today was eh.</h1>
    <p>There were like 6 questions and an informational essay we had to write. And I sure did write an informational essay. After, we went to 2nd period for a bit and I read more of Memnoch the Devil (I started reading it a week or two ago, by the way). Then we went to 3rd period and I watched IWTV and caught up on my Duolingo for Spanish class. And in Spanish class, we went over reflexive, indirect, and direct object verbs and went over workbook work.</p>
    <p>Goodbye</p>
