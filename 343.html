    <h4>9/22/23 &#45; 4:30 PM CDT &#45; Local Teen Performs, What Happens Next is SHOCKING...</h4>
    <h1>today was mediocre</h1>
    <p>In JROTC we played ultimate frisbee, and the guys kept hogging the frisbee from the girls, so that was epic! Plus we celebrated the birthday of the US Air Force (although late), and we ate cupcakes and drank Caprisuns (ermm instructor almost called me a guy, kind of a win!!!). In Algebra, we "explored" functions. I don't know how to explain that. Interpret that as you wish. In Culinary, I played TRD once more because I've been already finished with everything. In theater, we performed our three line monologues, and I almost avoided performing until Monday, but of course the teacher called on me as the second to last to perform. Nothing was shocking by the way, I just recited a monologue with little-to-no emotion or movement in front of the class, unlike how I was actually going to do it, and then sat down.</p>
    <p>Bye</p>
