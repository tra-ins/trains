    <h4>4/20/23 &#45; 4:43 PM CDT &#45; TCAP Day 4 - Scheming</h4>
    <h1>TCAP ELA part 4; today was okay.</h1>
    <p>The only thing that happened during homeroom was an interaction between me and the kid who was a hypocrite about saying excuse me. I was calling for the teacher, saying "Ms. ___", but that kid was like, "her name is "Ms. ___" not "___", then I was like, "I SAID MS. ___". But she did answer my question :)</p>
    <p>TCAP- 17 questions in 45 minutes; some were a little hard but the rest was okay. Forgot to put my backpack on the counter and almost panicked when I realized midway through the TCAP, luckily the teacher just told me it was okay when I informed her of it.</p>
    <p>ELA Space Race, but wow, the teacher and my classmates were roasting Russell Terriers and small dogs. My dog isn't small, rather medium, but she is a JACK Russell Terrier, so I'm a bit offended that they'd dare say those things.</p>
    <p>Umm math, the teacher was telling us how this lady in a Ted video about proving the Pythagorean theorem was in his 8th grade math class or something like that, I don't know nor care.</p>
    <p>Went to social studies for the rest of the day after; we did a Kahoot on units 1-3 of social studies for the TCAP next week, I obviously won, and a bit after I won, my "friend" and ex-crush were saying how I was scheming. My "friend" was like (not verbatim), "she's always scheming" and my ex-crush was like, "I KNOW RIGHT!". I'm honored!!!</p>
    <p>JTA Day 44</p>
    <p>Bye</p>
