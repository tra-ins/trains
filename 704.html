    <h4>9/17/24 &#45; 4:51 PM CDT &#45; Will I Finish the Essay? Stay Tuned to Find Out!</h4>
    <h1>Today was bland.</h1>
    <p>In Criminal Justice we talked about the Constitution. In Geometry we talked about congruency. In English we had to work on the essay (I actually started my body paragraphs. Have not finished that nor have I started the introduction or conclusion. It's due tomorrow). In Spanish we did a Gimkit, workbook work, and a quiz, and my friend who I still haven't received a letter back from responded to my text and we talked :3333</p>
    <p>Bye</p>
