    <h1>Today (Tuesday) was okay! (Update- I forgot to publish this lol)</h1>
    <p>Science was fine but we had to answer questions from a 10 page pdf (EMS, Electromagnetic Spectrum) (it wasn't hard, just annoying), ELA was cool, math was math, and we skipped related arts to watch a wrestling match between our school and some other school (we won 66-18).</p>
    <p>Got a packet of the full results from that one test and cried of laugher reading it! So glad I don't have to do that program anymore!! :)</p>
    <p>Bye</p>
