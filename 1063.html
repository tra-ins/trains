    <h4>9/11/25 &#45; 5:51 PM CDT &#45; Oh Right, 9/11</h4>
    <h1>today was also good!</h1> 
    <p>In English class we didn't do much for a while, I talked to my new pal a bit, and I went to go see the DE counselor about the fact I missed the DE check-in. Oops. So I got that taken care of, and when I walk back in the classroom there are 10+ people standing up with books about to perform more of Act 3 of The Crucible, very loud. I panic. I want to play Mary Warren. I always play Mary Warren. Luckily, the guy who was chosen to play her was okay with giving his part to me. So I had a great time, and my new pal played Abigail. We are so close to one of the best, if not, the best parts of the play. Well, after that, we talk a bit and she asks me, "BTW what are your pronouns?" and I immediately say, "It's a seeeeeeeeeecret!" and she responds with, "What?" and I repeat, "IT'S A SEEEEEEECRET!!!" I think she got the memo. She then walks me to my class and tells me about the "tea" (I genuinely for a moment thought she meant actual tea, but she just meant gossip) of her ex having incestuous relations. Um. Okay. In AV Production I had a wonderful conversation about Pokemon and consoles and that Freshman and I showed each other our 3ds/2ds. I had a great time. After, I worked on my speech. In Algebra I did work and got free chips for correcting my teacher's mistake. Yay! In 4th block I worked on my speech and messaged my friend (not my new pal).</p>
    <p>bye bye</p>
