    <h4>8/22/23 &#45; 4:44 PM CDT &#45; Rifle</h4>
    <h1>today sucky suck</h1>
    <p>In JROTC we started practicing the 15 count manual of arms thing and I never got a chance at holding one of the replica rifles. Awesomesauce!!!! Algebra we did Algebra. Culinary we did some group thing with recipes and stuff. In theater we did a few activities (like one two three flamingo or whtever etc) and then we had to pose like a silly prompt for a family picture. My group got clowns. That's all of that, really.</p>
