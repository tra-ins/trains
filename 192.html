    <h4>4/24/23 &#45; 4:38 PM CDT &#45; TCAP Day 5 - That Blooket</h4>
    <h1>TCAP Part 5!! Math subpart 1, pretty easy though honestly. Today was okay.</h1>
    <p>Ok uhhh after the TCAPs we just went on phones, after we'd go to ELA and do some Space Race, not much because the teacher's reading wouldn't download so she gave up and let us finish Harriet early. Uhh lunch she asked how I was doing, and I never said anything, but I forgot what she said after.</p>
    <p>After ELA and lunch, we went to math, where the teacher made us try the 5 house puzzle thing for 25 (later 30 or 35) dollars. It's literally impossible.</p>
    <p>Went back to homeroom and did a Blooket on TCAP social studies review. I did 160 questions and got all of them correct, but someone swapped treasure with me at the last second, leading me to my downfall. But I did win a tower defense one on logos. "Who's Rose Walker [randomized name]?" "me [I am the elusive Rose Walker; she looked at the leaderboard and saw the 160 questions all correct]" "I figured it was you". Wow, ok. Rest was just on my phone doing stuff, whatever.</p>
    <p>idk i dont feel like counting jta cuz i frogot abt it weeks ago</p>
    <p>Bye.</p>
