    <h4>1/12/23 &#45; 4:56 PM CST &#45; "Apply Yourself"</h4>
    <h1>Today was pretty good until lunch. Also PE was mid.</h1>
    <p>In social studies, we did notes and started on a pamphlet project (that's easy and I could've finished during RTI anyway). In ELA we did more of the balcony scene of Romeo and Juliet, I got half laudable and half infamous on the personality quiz thing. After, I actually answered like 2 questions for once (though, the teacher called on me both times IIRC), and was chosen by sticks last to go up and do this activity where you place the word that refers to either Juliet or the Moon. It was easy. Lunch was terrible and my friend kept bothering me and wouldn't respect me, to the point where after hitting him with my lunch box, I started crying. Also, leaving lunch, there was a spider. Right behind me. I didn't see it until one of my classmates screamed and told me about it. It died, by the way.</p>
    <p>Math was the English RTI test thing, about some kid not being able to think of a story and ended up plagiarizing some random short story, and admitting it to the teacher. "APPLY YOURSELF" IS BAD ADVICE BY THE WAY (IT'S GIVING "GIFTED" TEACHER GEE IDK WHY, IT REMINDS ME OF THOSE DUMB FIXED AND GROTH MINDSET CHARTS). PE was just some Pacman (?) game where you had to run away from the 2 people in the blue pennies and stay on the lines. I didn't try much, but did survive one round by some miracle. RTI was RTI, Tetris is fun but my teacher really thought that I lost when she saw me celebrating my win against Ess (IIRC).</p>
    <p>I NEED ASSISTANCE. TETRIS IS TOO GOOD Y'ALL...anyway time to finish my pamphlet :DDD</p>
    <p>uhh ummm do not listen to the title</p>
    <p>bye bye</p>
