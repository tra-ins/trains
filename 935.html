    <h4>5/5/25 &#45; 4:45 PM CDT &#45; ASVAB</h4>
    <h1>Today was eh.</h1> 
    <p>I got 4 teachers to sign my yearbook today. Took the ASVAB, had a headache the entire day, did work in Spanish, and worked on my project in Biology. Went to the nurse during Biology but I can't get any ibuprofen unless I bring it in at the beginning of the year so I got mints.</p>
    <p>bye</p>
