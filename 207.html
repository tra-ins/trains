    <h4>5/9/23 &#45; 4:54 PM CDT &#45; Mass Perplexion</h4>
    <h1>Today was mid.</h1>
    <p>People talking about me when I'm right there is the theme for today :D</p>
    <p>Like in the gym waiting to be called to go to class...</p>
    <p>And in homeroom! THE HYPROCRITE KID KEEPS ASKING ME IF I'M RACIST, GIRL [THEY'RE A GUY] BYE.</p>
    <p>While on the way to science, that kid told my "friend" that I hate him (I do) and then said that I was racist. I'M SO CONFUSED. AT LEAST I WROTE LIKE 1 AND A HALF PAGES OF MY PAPER; ON PAGE 9 :DDD</p>
    <p>Uhhh ELA we did the Space Race assessment, but the teacher just helped us on all, and I think tomorrow we'll start on the Holocaust. Oh God.</p>
    <p>In math, we did our bathroom break as usual, and the teacher gave the girls [us] 20 dollars to spend at the IA teacher with the food's store. I just left them all to go back to class, lol. And then the teacher started saying how he thinks China is going to rule the world and how the world changed in 60 years (he's 62 years old).</p>
    <p>In theater, we started watching HAMILTONNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN SLAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYY</p>
    <p>At PE, I asked the teachers if I could go "steal" this chair that's randomly there outside, and the two were like "steal???", and I was like "yeah", then they were like, "ok 5 minutes". So I sat in that chair for EXACTLY 5 minutes and...1 second. I set a timer on my watch and it said that when I paused. Anyway, later on, these people were calling me from behind, but I didn't want to talk to anyone, and THEN, AND THEN, AND THEEENNNNN, my "friend" ("friend" = guy I used to be friends with earlier in the year fyi) told them that, AND I QUOTE, (she = me btw but tbh I kind of hate being called she) "she doesn't talk to black people". What. And then they all started talking trash about me. What a fun day.</p>
    <p>Uhh that's really it for today. I am indeed in a state of mass perplexion. Perplexion is a word ISTG--</p>
    <p>Bye?</p>
