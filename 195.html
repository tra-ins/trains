    <h4>4/27/23 &#45; 4:51 PM CDT &#45; TCAP Day 8 - The Final TCAP</h4>
    <h1>TCAP Part 8; Social studies done!! Today was also okay.</h1>
    <p>The social studies TCAP parts were easy but I wasn't sure of 2-5 of them because I forgot to look through my notes after doing the practice TCAP last night...help??</p>
    <p>Uhh after TCAPs did nothing in class and ELA, umm oh!</p>
    <p>Math, we did boys vs girls (sorry gender non-conforming, etc, etc folks) math riddles, and so far the girls are winning! Yay!!!</p>
    <p>After, just went to theater and watched more Shrek.</p>
    <p>And RTI in which we did the usual, though that crusty emo kid got into ANOTHER fight, but this time apparently had a black eye and other injuries. LLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL</p>
    <p>Honestly not much to say about today?</p>
    <p>Bye</p>
