    <h4>1/13/23 &#45; 4:56 PM CST &#45; Dodgeball</h4>
    <h1>Today was great, actually. Completely forgot about Friday the 13th, I think everyone did too.</h1>
    <p>Report card grades for Quarter 2 (got during the Friday assembly) - 100 A in everything but a 97 A in ELA.</p>
    <p>Science project, whatever, I slipped on the icy wood on the way to ELA (it snowed a little bit, like a tiny bit, mostly dried up in like an hour). In ELA we did more silly Romeo & Juliet stuff, Amplify wouldn't load so we had to write down some. It did finally load and I also had been ignoring my friend (because of yesterday) until I couldn't think of a metaphor to describe Juliet as Romeo. All the good ones were already used, ok, also I don't have any (rl) crushes, so why would I need to know any pickup lines? Played and WON Uno during lunch, yeah whatever, but after, I went up to the teacher and asked her for help and she said something like about how I'm too "literal"??? WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN MRS. [____]??? I JUST COULDN'T THINK OF ANY METAPHORS??????????? HOW IS THAT--oh wait--nvm, BUT STILL!!! Moving on, a classmate's water bottle hydroflask thing fell (I was turned in the direction of the incident and watched it fall), and everyone was screaming, and it fell again and LANDED UPRIGHT. Needless to say, "IT LANDED!!!" was heard and yelled from across the room. Anyway, I got 95th percentile on the ENGLISH RTI test thing but it doesn't matter because there's no way I would get into RTI lol (IDK about math but I don't think I failed at least).</p>
    <p>Uhhhh math textbook thing? Honestly I can't remember if we really did anything memorable during math.</p>
    <p>PE was interesting. Came a bit too early and didn't go meet with the art teacher because the door was closed and I didn't feel like bothering her about PE (like I've been doing). There were far less people (I think nobody had extra PE whether during period 7 or not on Fridays). We played this dodgeball-esque game where 3 people throw balls at everyone while they run to the other side of the gym. I wasn't that bad at the game (although I got very close to winning a lot, and one time I got tagged by some girl and was MAD. HOW DID SHE EVEN KNOW MY NAME--) and I ended up being the last one left (didn't even get hit) one round (despite already being exhausted), and got to be one of the throwers. I was close but fairly inaccurate at throwing, at least I hit the teacher while she joined in! WHAT WHY WAS PE NOT TERRIBLE (MINUS HOW HOT IT WAS AND I WAS SWEATING IN MY HOODIE)???</p>
    <p>Finished coloring my pamphlet social studies thing during RTI (I finished writing last night) and just listened to music and played Tetris. Yay, my teacher liked my cute extra pictures :)))</p>
    <p>Last night I beat the main story (act 7 done) of Puyo Puyo Tetris. I started 2 during RTI!!!!</p>
