    <h4>3/9/23 &#45; 5:34 PM CST &#45; Slave Auction</h4>
    <h1>Today was mediocre.</h1>
    <p>My social studies teacher is absent today and tomorrow, so I had math for split list. I just did the assignment on Teams from social studies (got 113/100 on it lol, it was a webquest on And*ew Jacks*n ew). Also my crush was absent today (weary emoji).</p>
    <p>Anyway, in ELA we read chapter 8 and the split list kids in the classroom were complaining about the social studies teacher blocking Spotify and then the ELA teacher told us how the ss teacher's in a car with her family and probably misses us so much that she wanted to mess with us with Netref (looking at our screens!!!). Anyway, after that, the ELA teacher demonstrated to us a slave auction with my classmates and I tried not to laugh. Didn't buy anyone as chattels, but we did get to witness a bunch of classmates bidding on the other classmates who were acting as slaves and getting to 'own' them, and seeing the teacher value and showcase them. I am crying thinking of this memory. I am morally sound in this situation somehow.</p>
    <p>After lunch, we did our bathroom break and this one is remarkable because ykw girl asked me if it was bad to have a two year age gap or something. I said, "it depends" and she was like, "see? it depends!!!". I don't want to think about this for longer.</p>
    <p>Math benchmark, literally nobody finished.</p>
    <p>In PE, they made us go outside and frisbee into groups of 12, and I was forced into this group of girls. I didn't want to frisbee, so I stood against the fence and watched in the opposite direction of the field. At one point I started throwing a few rocks and some girl who looked like they're from Beta or something complimented my throw (thanks irrelevant scum), and later on, some girl called I think me in fact, ACTUALLY THE SAME GIRL FROM THE BLEACHERS THAT ONE TIME WHO CALLED ME A WHITE--yeah, a crazy [b word], well she worded it as something like, "that [b word] crazy" but still.</p>
    <p>Anyway, in RTI, I had a different teacher for split list, the other ELA teacher. Not mine, the other one. I've been in her classroom once before and this time I sat right next to the door and played on my laptop until the laptop people came and took my laptop. I snuck on my phone (IDK if it was "snuck" because I had no clue if we were allowed to go on them) and did some silly texting.</p>
    <p>Ok.</p>
    <p>JTA Day 3.</p>
    <p>Bye.</p>
