    <h4>4/21/23 &#45; 4:42 PM CDT &#45; There's a New Kid Ft. Another Honor Roll Party</h4>
    <h1>TCAPs resuming next week; today was okay though.</h1>
    <p>Yesterday I spent 2 hours trying to spin a pencil, and today I kept trying during class. Like I was only focused on the pencil yesterday. I'm not sure how that much time went by of me just endlessly spinning, but ok??</p>
    <p>Yo, there's a new kid from the same county. Wait, they went here before--in 6th grade. WHY HAS EVERY "NEW" KID BEEN AT THIS SCHOOL BEFORE??</p>
    <p>Science; riddles and stuff, IDK.</p>
    <p>Bucks day in ELA, teacher made me tell her what to get me to spend all of my huge load of bucks. I think she feels bad for me, LOL. Fruit by the Foot.</p>
    <p>For some reason during lunch, the new kid sat across from me, but we made no eye contact and ignored each other. AITA--also the Honor Roll Party started at this time, but I didn't go like last time.</p>
    <p>During math class, we just did review and IXL, and wow, the teacher actually got me a Diet Coke. I'm honored that he'd offer me one for once. It was so quiet in there.</p>
    <p>At theater, the teacher was trying to get us to dance like some song from Mean Girls (I'm watching tonight for the first time with friends though) but everyone just sat down as the audience, so he just let us sit and do whatever.</p>
    <p>RTI, whatever, the usual.</p>
    <p>JTA Day 45</p>
    <p>Bye</p>
