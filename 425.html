    <h4>12/13/23 &#45; 4:45 PM CST &#45; Reservist</h4>
    <h1>today was cowabummer kind of</h1>
    <p>In JROTC, we practiced the 30 step drill thing, and I HEARD THAT JC IS GOING TO BE A RESERVIST CADET NEXT SEMESTER (plus they're a Senior...) SO I'LL BASICALLY NEVER SEE HER AGAIN AFTER NEXT WEEK OR SO. BRO. BRO. BRO. AND I EVEN BUMPED INTO HER ON THE WAY TO CULINARY, LIKE I ALMOST RAN STRAIGHT INTO HER. Anyway, in Algebra, we started our final project. In Culinary, I ran straight down to get my JROTC unit picture taken, then came back to Culinary and ate the jello salad thing we made Monday and Tuesday. It was pretty good. And in theater, I think I'm nearly done with my final project, just have to do the monologue thing. Also next week is finals week technically, not this week but shhh...</p>
    <p>Bye</p>
