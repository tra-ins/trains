    <h4>8/12/24 &#45; 4:52 PM CDT &#45; Today Was Boring?</h4>
    <h1>Yesterday I went to the store and then spent like 4 hours organizing my closet. And nothing really happened today.</h1>
    <p>Criminal Justice started the first unit, Geometry learned something I've probably learned before and was really hungry so I ate lunch early, English finished the last part of my poem and annotated and read The Refusal by Kafka. It was quite interesting!!! And Spanish learned about the animals and my teacher yapped about how much he loved serving in the Navy.</p> 
    <p>pretty much it i guess goodbye</p>
