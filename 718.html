    <h4>10/1/24 &#45; 5:00 PM CDT &#45; Wow, I'm Exempt!</h4>
    <h1>Criminal Justice we talked about traffic stops. Geometry we did midterm review (though I don't have to take the midterm itself). English we read more of Night, and I'm exempt from the midterm somehow. Spanish we did more work and quizes and Gimkits. I'm exempt from every midterm!</h1>
    <p>Bye</p>
