    <h1>today was mid</h1>
    <p>In JROTC, we didn't really do anything until the guest speaker came, who was some Navy guy, I don't know. In Algebra, I won a Gimkit, even though I only had like 3,163 cash, but everyone else's money was in the double digits, so. In Culinary, we're hopefully cooking this week??? We did a packet about knives, and we're going to practice cutting soon, so hopefully... And in theater, we're doing this project where we do like a script analysis thing for a scene from a play, and I'm still reading Death of a Salesman first, so.</p>
    <p>bye</p>
