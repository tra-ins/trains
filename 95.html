    <h4>1/17/23 &#45; 6:10 PM CST &#45; Art > PE!!!</h4>
    <h1>Today wasn't terrible.</h1>
    <p>My mom has been in Vegas since Sunday and comes back tomorrow night I think, and she's really mad at me because I kept begging her not to go to school!</p>
    <p>Social studies!!! :DDDDD IT WAS ACTUALLY A TYPO MS. ____!!!!! I'M SO EMBARRASSED!!! Also yes, today was an A day because yesterday was off and for some reason I thought today would be a B day (it's Tuesday innit). So much for 5 hours of the science project :(</p>
    <p>In ELA we wrote things. And I spoke once after being asked a question while the teacher held a baton (?) thing. I THOUGHT WE WERE STARTING FUNCTIONS IN MATH WHY DIDN'T WE DO IT??</p>
    <p>ALSO YAYYYY I DON'T HAVE TO GO TO PE DURING PERIOD 7 (AND POSSIBLY EXTRA PE IF IT'S CLARIFIED BECAUSE I STILL CAME TODAY AND IT WASN'T THAT BAD, TALKED TO MY FRIEND A LITTLE AND KEPT STEALING THE BALL FROM HIM). In period 7 Art I just drew a pineapple pizza political rally. Also didn't do the soccer manager thing. Lol.</p>
    <p>bye</p>
