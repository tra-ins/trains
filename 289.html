    <h4>7/30/23 &#45; 8:40 PM CDT &#45; Heathers 35th Anniversary</h4>
    <h1>today was pretty good i think</h1>
    <p>Ate at Chilis (yummy spicy chicken sandwich), saw the Heathers 35th Anniversary screening in theaters with my mom and sis (dressed in Heathers colors minus yellow because I do not have yellow and had a cherry slushie too), begged for posters, went to Target and got a lot of clothes, and now am home.</p>
    <p>bye</p>
