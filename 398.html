    <h4>11/16/23 &#45; 4:47 PM CST &#45; Dot Plot</h4>
    <h1>today was eh</h1>
    <p>In JROTC, we did the PT test (smh embarrassed myself in front of JROTC crush wa). In Algebra, we learned more about graphs or whatever, like dot plots. In Culinary, I did nothing. And in theater, we did some thing I didn't do because I didn't have a group, as usual.</p>
    <p>bye</p>
