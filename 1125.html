    <h4>11/12/25 &#45; 5:30 PM CST &#45; local student DOES NOT sabotage their college career</h4>
    <h1>today was yes. ya,.</h1> 
    <p>in english i woked on my speech ad then went to guidance and established a meeting during 4th block because i realized info (we only have to do 2/3 of the speeches to pass the class)/didnt know the info was that important and so was trying to get the speech extended. av tried to write ideas 4 the group project and my teacher brought in a life sized foam horse in! algebra did notes. 4th block the counselor came in like 20 minutes into class and she took me out of the classroom with my professor and my professor todl me that because the syllabus wasnt updated to say that you were required to present 3/3 of the speeches instead of 2/3 of the speeches, that i and everyone else didn't have to do all 3 speeches (it says "present" which implies that you must do the outline, but she just made it count for the entire speech)!!!!!!!!! i found a loophole to pass the class!!! im not failing because i didnt do the informative speech!!!!i  feel like im the smartest person alive</p>
    <p>bye</p>
