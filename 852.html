    <h4>2/12/25 &#45; 4:59 PM CST &#45; Travel Agency</h4>
    <h1>Today was fine.</h1>
    <p>In JROTC we practiced rifles. In CJ we did notes, and I got called down to the office to choose my classes for next year. Folks, I'm going to try to graduate early. I'm taking 2 DE classes (US History and Sociology), Spanish 3, TN History (a quarter long), ACT Prep (also a quarter long I believe), English 3, Chemistry, Algebra 2, and CJ 3. Although this is subject to change. In Spanish, we're starting chapter 1 of the textbook, and we have a project due in 3 weeks where my partner (something something ahhh!!! spooky Her!!!! oohhhh; she's been ok) and I have to make a fictional travel agency's itinerary for a 6 person family. Fun! It really isn't that bad though. I think we could finish in a few days. In Biology we did a lab where we constructed models of the stages of mitosis on an Oreo with sprinkles and we got to eat them. Yay.</p>
