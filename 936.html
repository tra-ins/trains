    <h4>5/7/25 &#45; 5:29 PM CDT &#45; No More Uniform Days</h4>
    <h1>Today was ok.</h1> 
    <p>JROTC learned that uniform wear was optional. Whoops. But that means today was my last uniform day!! I just have to turn in my clothes now. In CJ we did notes. In Spanish we did work and such. In Biology I finished my project.</p>
