    <h4>2/20/23 &#45; 7:05 PM CST &#45; Presidents' Day</h4>
    <h1>Ah yes, celebrating Washington's birthday on the third Monday of February (so not on 22nd this year or the next, or the 2nd next, but it makes sense to give us a three day weekend).</h1>
    <p>Also I didn't go outside, but I did play DOOMORI for like 5 hours and finally beat it and Eternal. Oh god.</p>
    <p>idk!!!!</p>
    <p>Bye</p>
