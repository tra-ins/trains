    <h4>1/20/23 &#45; 5:05 PM CST &#45; Jr. Beta?</h4>
    <h1>Today was fine.</h1>
    <p>Uhhh woke up at like 7:20 AM oops, luckily my mom was gonna take me at 7:45 anyway.</p>
    <p>Another science project! At least it's easier and I finished most of the constellations during class.</p>
    <p>I missed the fight scene with Tybalt and Mercutio (RIP) and got help from the teacher to finish the lesson I missed. Also she let me buy Fruit Roll-ups with my bucks (she gives it to the computer people but I never buy anything so she let me have a box), and barely managed to finish Amplify Grammar in time.</p>
    <p>Uhh math was easy SLOPE FOR SOME REASON and Poptart.</p>
    <p>Art I drew requests from my sister and TOMMY. I was forced to draw a silly picture of my sister and one of me (Kim K Snap pic), and Basil. Help.</p>
    <p>Finished missed work in RTI and slayed. I think my friend slapped this guy in my class or something because he was crying? IDK I was focused on the quiz.</p>
    <p>Also in ELA I was confused when my name was called to go to the office and I got an invitation to Jr. Beta. I bet that if I won the Uno game I would join, but I lost. Clueless if I should join or not now, but I don't want to do community service, so. Sounds like NJHS by another name.</p>
    <p>bye</p>
