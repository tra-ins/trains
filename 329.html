    <h4>9/8/23 &#45; 5:34 PM CDT &#45; Parade</h4>
    <h1>TODAY.</h1>
    <p>In JROTC, we picked up trash, again. I just wandered around and then studied a little and played Tetris after. In Algebra, I got a 95 on my test because I put a negative instead of a positive ONCE. grrrrrr!!!!!!! In Culinary, I already finished everything, so I just sat on my phone. Theater we watched some Shakespeare play thing, but was cut short by a pep rally. I got picked up by my mom after, changed into my JROTC blues, and got McDonald's. Then, I headed to the meeting space, but these 2 girls in polos told my mom that the parade already ended. I wanted a promotion and service hours :((</p>
    <p>UGHHHHHHHHHHH I KEEP MESSING THINGS UPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP bye</p>
