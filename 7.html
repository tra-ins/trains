    <h4>10/21/22 &#45; 5:05 PM CDT &#45; Debate</h4>
    <h1>Actually the debate is on Monday but--</h1>
    <p>I'm so stressed WHY DID ONE OF MY GROUP MEMBERS HAVE TO BE ABSENT TODAY, SHE HADN'T EVEN DONE THE REBUTTAL PART SO NOW I HAD TO WRITE IT AND I DIDN'T EVEN FINISH IT</p>
    <p>Oh well, my English teacher told me to come to their class during RTI and I didn't because I DIDN'T FINISH IT</p>
    <p>I wonder what my English teacher thinks of me now, because she probably has super high standards for me just because my grades are decent aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa</p>
    <p>Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, report cards yeah, I told y'all it didn't matter.</p>
    <p>Art class was actually fine today, and I got a 98 on a math test because I DID ALL OF THE STEPS CORRECTLY BUT SOMEHOW WROTE THE WRONG ANSWER??? IT WAS JUST 60 DIVIDED BY -30, THAT'S LITERALLY -2 BUT I WROTE -30 INSTEADDDDDD??????????????</p>
    <p>Ok byee</p>
