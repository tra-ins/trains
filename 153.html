    <h1>Today was mid.</h1>
    <p>Social studies, it was just a day to complete missing work so I made LOTS of progress on my MC world. Built a sloop in the dock, just in case I need to coup Nicaragua or some other Central American country, did lots of progress to the plantation, etc.</p>
    <p>ELA was the usual, I guess. I think ELA or some other class one of my crush's friends said hi to me randomly, I forgot which period.</p>
    <p>Lunch I ultimately moved from my usual table to a spot on a random table alone. My so called "friend" didn't try very hard to get my attention luckily, and I got to eat and think peacefully. My ELA teacher called my name and was like "I love your new wardrobe" or something like that I don't know and don't remember properly, and I was like "Thanks, Mrs. []".</p>
    <p>Uhh easy math test yeah.</p>
    <p>During PE, we went outside with the entirety of my school (not the 'magnet' school haha) and took a picture in the shame of the letters of the acronym referring to the school. I would've worn my Beta ceremony suit if I knew about this prior. Ugh I was wearing a nice blue, orange, and white stripped collared shirt with a black tie and sweater but the black tie from Amazon that came yesterday was wayy too long to have open. Ugh. Also, I had to tell my "friend" to shut up because he kept telling everyone my name and stuff and was being annoying as usual. Also the other science teacher lady came back??</p>
    <p>Uhh RTI was fine, another one of my crush's friends said hi randomly, and I said hi back (not the same person as earlier on in this update), and I just did IXL and stuff, one of my crush's friends (the one that said hi in ELA or some other period, not RTI) asked me the name of the guy who went to the Methodist camp-meeting or whatever (In the Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, lol) and I said 'Captain Auld' (I was right), and she and my crush were like "I told you so" or something to this guy. I love overhearing conversations that involve my crush!</p>
    <p>Rizz Status: None.</p>
    <p>JTA Day 10.</p>
    <p>Bye.</p>
