    <h4>8/16/23 &#45; 4:58 PM CDT &#45; Uniform</h4>
    <h1>today sucks again again</h1>
    <p>In JROTC we did our uniform thing, and while one of the instructors was telling us about how if we feel like fainting, we should sit down, while I was just there in the ranks, face actually green and head getting swirly and dotty and the voices getting quieter and then the sergeant or whoever pointed it out and I had to sit down and drink water until the voices got louder. So yay, almost vomited and/or fainted during JROTC! Then like a couple minutes after I went to the bathroom and back there, where we practiced doing faces (haha I know them because of ROBLOX military groups).</p>
    <p>In Algebra we just did Algebra. After, I walked up the stairs and then all the way to my 3rd period just to check in with the teacher, and then I walked all the way down and back to A lunch (not my normal lunch period), where I just ate part of my lunch, and then I went to the theater for some JROTC thing. Uhhh I can't really remember what we were told during the JROTC thing, but I do remember that we had to go BACK to 3rd period. All those stairs and halls. Just to go back to 3rd period for 10 minutes, AND get a packet of MATH homeroom for CULINARY ARTS. And then I went back all the way down to eat D lunch. At least I kind of had two lunch periods? Then I walked ALL THE WAY BACK UP to theater, in which we did some "onstage" thing but for the majority of the period I just listened to music and texted my mom about binders or something.</p>
    <p>bye</p>
